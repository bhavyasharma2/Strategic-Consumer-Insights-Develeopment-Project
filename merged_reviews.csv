R20IRE5X6WY351,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Talia Calazans,5,"I love these headphones, and I wear them all the time. They are pretty comfortable and also very cute. They are not too bulky. The noise cancelling is not great at cancelling voices, it really just cancels out background hums, which was a bit frustrating, but does well enough on things like planes. Other than that the sound is pretty good (as someone who does not care much about super high quality sound so I'm pleased with not bad). Battery is good, will last me a few days of pretty extensive use. Bought these on sale for $70 and it was increadibly worth it for this price.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AG6TODKB7VQYDH7KJ2MKHF6RQEGA,True,7,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3
RFGOLBEISEB55,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,Leosha Williams,5,"These headphones are absolutely amazing! The volume, how they fit, the price, all top tier! I was stuck between these and the solo 3’s. I did my research and saw that the Solo 3’s can get uncomfortable after a while and that they don’t have noise cancellation. So I switched my focus onto the studios, and I'm glad that I did. The quality of these headphones is phenomenal! The bass sounds great. The headphones already drown outside noise out, but then when you cut the Actuve noise cancellation on, it’s like you’re in the world alone. I really couldn’t hear anything. Another plus is the fact that I have 21 days to add AppleCare+ to them. All of my products are protected with Applecare+ and this one will be as well. I definitely recommend these headphones if you’re looking for a great pair with noise cancellation and great studio sound! 10/10!","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFBT2YGFVT6CBITOKGANUEJ5WYHA,True,8,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

There are a lot of different headphones you can buy, but as far as over the ear headphones these are great. Very light, get a little discomfort after long use, but not bad at all. Sound is great quality especially for the gym which is my main use for these. Just be sure to wash the ear pads if you do this. Comes with an aux cord as well incase you need to hook them up differently than Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGONEWJIIDADSFNMIJQESOKWVG3A,True,1,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

R2AGD67A8P04AC,B085296FLT,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, just don't fit my big ears.",Jacob,4,"Jan 2023 - First, I am not an audiophile. So, this review will not be super technical, just an average Joe who doesn't mind paying for quality products.I did quite a bit of research before buying my next set of headphones. I read tons of reviews on Amazon and the web. I read multiple ""review/ratings"" articles online that compared numerous headphones. Ultimately, I decided to buy these because I have an iPhone and AppleTV that they work seamlessly with, and they were always rated highly at their price point.I've used them for about 2 months now. They were simple to pair with my iPhone. When I am in my living room with my AppleTV on and I turn them on, my AppleTV asks me if I want to pair them, and they have done that easily every single time. I love this seamless functionality.I use them at work primarily. I work in office with 20+ cubes. I use them often simply for the noise-canceling to stay focused, and I use them just as often to listen to podcasts and music. When in noise-canceling mode, they do not remove 100% of every sound around you. No headphones can (that I am aware of). But, they do a great job creating a virtually noise free environment with a light ""white noise"" in the background (similar to a fan in the distance). You can turn noise-canceling off, and then the noises around you are simply muffled (if you're not actively playing something on the device you're connected to).As mentioned previously, I listen to podcasts, music, and watch TV and movies with these. I think they sound fantastic with all of these. Occasionally, they do sound just a tiny bit bass-heavy for some of the music I listen to or during movies with high-action scenes that have a lot of explosions, but that's just me I guess. Some people probably prefer that with the music/media they have.My one peeve is that they don't completely fit over my ears. The good news is the cushions on the earcups are super soft. So, I can still wear them comfortably... for hours. This doesn't seem to affect the noise-canceling at all.Lastly, they seem to have a really good battery life with my usage style. I use them for varying lengths of time. At work, it's not uncommon to get interrupted and need to turn them off after 5-10 mins because I need to step away from my desk, and sometimes I will have them on for 2+ hours. At home, I often use them at night to watch stuff on my AppleTV so that I don't take a chance of waking up my kids while they are sleeping, and I can get hours of watch time in without needing to charge them (as long as they weren't close to being dead already).If you can get them on sale (like I did: $170), I wouldn't hesitate to buy them, and I saw them on sale a lot (but the sale price varied quite a bit) leading up to my purchase. I don't even think their regular price is all that bad for what you get.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2023",AH3SC2BAKM6AA7XJMTJ4KAET6MSQ,True,91,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3
R1UVTRVZ4F5DME,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars LONG battery life.,Julian,5,"I recently invested in the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, and the experience has been nothing short of exceptional. These headphones effortlessly blend style, comfort, and cutting-edge technology, creating a remarkable auditory journey for music lovers and audiophiles alike.The standout feature of the Beats Studio3 is its impressive noise-canceling capability. The headphones effectively block out external sounds, providing an immersive and uninterrupted listening experience. Whether I'm in a noisy commute, a bustling café, or even on an airplane, the noise-canceling feature allows me to escape into my music without being disturbed by the outside world.Comfort is paramount during prolonged use, and the Beats Studio3 excels in this aspect. The over-ear design, combined with plush ear cushions, ensures a snug fit without causing discomfort or pressure. The headphones are lightweight, making them ideal for extended listening sessions without causing fatigue. The adjustable headband allows for a customized fit, ensuring a secure and comfortable feel.The sound quality of the Beats Studio3 is exceptional. The headphones deliver a robust and well-balanced audio experience, with crisp highs, rich mids, and powerful lows. The bass response, a signature of the Beats brand, adds depth to the music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm listening to energetic beats or soothing melodies, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive.The integration of Apple's W1 chip enhances the overall user experience. The seamless pairing process with Apple devices is a breeze, and the Class 1 Bluetooth connectivity provides a stable and reliable connection. The efficiency of the W1 chip also contributes to an extended battery life, allowing for up to 22 hours of playback on a single charge.The on-ear controls add a layer of convenience to the user experience. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and managing calls can be done effortlessly with intuitive controls located on the ear cups. The incorporation of Siri support allows for hands-free control, adding an extra layer of functionality.The durability and build quality of the Beats Studio3 are commendable. The premium materials used in construction give the headphones a sleek and sophisticated look, while also ensuring resilience to everyday wear and tear. The foldable design and included carrying case enhance portability, making them a practical choice for on-the-go lifestyles.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AHUVU5TLJQFQMZKFR7YKDB55USPA,True,22,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3
R1SMSYH9JKNH51,B085296FLT,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound Quality, but Lacking in Bass",prashant naik,5,"The Beats Studio headphones deliver impressive sound quality overall, with clear highs and detailed mids. However, I found them to be lacking in bass compared to other headphones in this price range. While the sound is well-balanced, bass enthusiasts may find it underwhelming. Despite this drawback, the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, with excellent noise isolation. If you prioritize balanced sound over heavy bass, these headphones are worth considering. Four stars.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AF7TF3C7U74FMUFC2FGM6GTADYMA,True,4,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3
R1H100TYFQZJLK,B085296FLT,2.0 out of 5 stars Please Read Before Buying.,O.Winnie Mittelberger,2,"My rating falls close to a 1.5 for multiple reasons:For starters, this headphone is marketed and sold as an ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), Over-Ear headphone. Typically, headphones like these are targeting people who buy them for travel (i.e. a plane ride) but also are helpful in any public space. Please keep this in mind for the rest of my comment. From the inside out, these headphones cannot hold their own with any other pair in the price range.I purchased my pair when they were 57% off, bringing the total from $350 to $160 (including tax), but I cannot in good conscious recommend them for either price bracket. Comparing them to the most common headphone in the $350 bracket, the Sony XM4 (and newly the XM5) are a essentially the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to all qualities. They clearly lose the battle for acceptable headphones to buy for $350, but some could make a case for the discounted price.Everything I found wrong with the Beats (most to least important):- Sound quality is mediocre.I attribute this to the old design (nearing 3 years) and old parts (Apples W1 chip is long outclassed by the newest chips)With that said, I am also no audiophile (someone who has a keen skill/desire for high quality sound) but I can make general observations about the sound quality from the Studio3's. I can't give an super detailed review of the sound quality because I only listened to ~3 songs and maybe 2 videos. But I can say is the trope that ""Beats just overbass their headphones"" isn't true. I can't say what you find as a proper balance of bass, but to me it seemed fined and not too far one way or the other. But you can tell that the timbre wasn't all that it could be. For the MSRP listed, this should not be case, even for an old design that was adopted and revamped by Apple.- ANC, one of the primary marketing points, is horrible.This is comes from a variety of reasons other than just poor build quality, after reading into the making of the Studio 3's, Beats tried making an early ""adaptive"" ANC by changing the way sound is measured, processed, and then cancelled.However, it fails completely and everything from your fingertips rubbing together at arms length, to a pencil dropping behind a closed door is essentially the same with/without ANC on.The only different is bass is slightly toned down, you don't feel like constantly pressure that other ANC headphones give (kinda like you're in an airplane at max altitude), but you hear a slight ""woosh"" constantly.- As mentioned before, build quality as a whole is terrible.Straight out the box, the right earcup is crumpled a towards the bottom because of a poorly designed folding mechanism that squishes the earcup against the headband as it's packed into the case. The earcups themselves have this cheap, fake leather look and feel, the stitching is far apart and looks poorly made, the earcup foam is obviously cheap, it easily compresses (therefore there's a lot of air) but then refills as if the foam itself isn't compact but just large pockets of air (meaning the foam itself is low quality), and the size of the earcups is very small for over-the-ear headphones. So if you happen to be ok with everything I mention, having medium-big ears will already make the experience impossible to begin with.The top headband, a common weakpoint that's overlooked in headphone design, has literally no cushioning.They didn't even use the foam from the earcups, it's rubber on the outside (when slightly damp or if it just came off someone's head) feels comparable to a pencil eraser. There is a little give to the headband but the material underneath is too thin for me to discern from just pushing down.After wearing the headphones, straight from the box, you could start ""feeling"" the headband begin pressing into your head after ~1 hour, then feel that annoying soreness after ~1.5 hours of total listening. Once again, considering travel or just extended use would be expected of a $350 headphone, there were too many bad choice they let slide.With the buttons provided on the headphone, there is one good but a few bad things.Firstly, Beats Studio3 happen to be one of the few headphones in this bracket that have a distinct power button. But the action button and touch pad are the main concern I found.A lot of online reviews will say the action button (the beats logo) feels cheap and totally disrupts the hearing experience, but I can't say I completely agree. I do like a tactile button, but the button provided has a distinct and somewhat loud click. It doesn't inherently sound cheap nor satisfying to me, but that's partly subjective. However, you can hear the click very clearly when you are wearing them so if that's something you dislike, and you'd prefer a touchpad then be aware of that.One of my most concerning observations for the build was the Micro USB charger in the headphones. A lot of online reviewers bash on the cable that's provided to charge the Studio3 pair, but I don't mind that they were able to pack some ginormous cable because I can plug in the USB A into a nearby port for close charging. However, the choice for Micro USB charging as a whole is a bad idea to me. Micro USB is getting very old now, being outshined by Lighting and USB C when it comes to things like charging speed, data transfer speed, etc. But my main concern is durability. Again, a $350 pair of headphones should essentially guarantee you multiple years of use. I didn't fully test the battery life of the pair, but over my years of use with Micro USB I know that the cable itself can corrode but most importantly if the input port (like the one that built into the headphones) doesn't have good glue to hold it to the plastic inside of the earcup, then the port can pop out can render the charging useless. In the first example of the cable breaking with time, I'm sure a lot of people have old Micro USB cables laying around, but if the input port falls out, then you will be forced to use the provided AUX cord for the headphones (can't listen to portless devices like modern iPhones).- All the other complaints were at least somewhat merited regarding an expensive headphone. But this one is mostly based on aesthetic.Of these entirely subjective points, the most relatable would be the bulky carrying case the headphones come in. It's very wide and rounded, so it definitely won't sit in a backpack or carry-on without taking up unnecessary space. But if the case was designed to be wider/longer but slimmer (like the Sony XM4's) it could slide into thinner pockets without stretching out the bag. Also, forcing the headphones into a smaller but thicker case is what causes that earcup compression problem I mentioned earlier.The scale of the headphones looks off. From product pictures to models wearing them, the headphones look really nice and stylish. I bought the matte black pair, and I was excited to see how they looked. But they pair overall seems smaller than what you expected (like how I briefly mentioned the small earcups). The overall look seems like it could only give that proper ""Beats"" look on certain people with specific head sizes/shapes.If you happen to find this pair on sale, don't really care too much about noise cancelling, want a listening experience that is good but you don't mind if it isn't groundbreaking, but want a pair of headphones for more of the luxury aspect, then it wouldn't seem like a bad deal to buy these.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2022",AH46ZHN22ZKGHWOM3UMMORBATP2Q,True,928,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

But when I saw this Beats item for $168, I decided to take a chance since this was a lot lower price for Beats headphones than I had ever seen. I was blown away by the sound and noise cancellation of this unit over my previous units. When you don’t have anything playing on them, the noise cancellation is on a par with my previous units, but when you use them for music or a phone call you are COMPLETELY isolated. I am now a believer in Beats. I have drank the kool-aid.

R2GCZUGFSPN9GD,B085296FLT,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent if you get them on sale,Derek Shoff,4,"I’ll start by saying that these are not worth the retail price of $350. But they often go on sale for around $170 which Is where they need to be priced at for the quality of sound you get. I ordered the grey with gold trim because they were the only ones on sale when I was in the market, which I do love th my is color but I really wanted the red ones. Which are now also on sale for the same price as the grey one. Added that into this review just to let you know if there is a certain color you want just be patient they will go on sale. Now with all that said a big part of the reason I bought these was the noise cancellation feature which is a joke. I have a $50 pair of over the ear onns that do a way better job of noise canceling than these do.so if you are buying for that feature alone I strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The sound quality is decent. It does not compare to a good pair of Bose but you will be paying double for a pair of Bose. As long as you get these on sale for $170 or less I think you’ll be happy with the purchase. The bass is a little disappointing I really expected it to thump from Beats by Dre. It is there you can hear it but it’s not great. The fact that these are Apple compatible was a big reason I bought them I can pair them and talk effortlessly when I get a phone call without ever taking my phone out of my pocket. The microphone is by no means great but the caller should be able to understand you as long as you speak loudly and clearly. If the overall look is something important to you than I imagine that’s why your shopping beats in the first place because they definitely look better than all of their competitors headphones. I will end this review with another huge reason as to why I settled on them personally and maybe you will to. These are built for people with smaller heads. I really wanted a good pair of headphones to work out in, that would stay on my head nice and tight and I knew from the reviews I read before buying that these would do just that. I imagine they can get a little uncomfortable for people with bigger heads because they do sit tight but they are perfect for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AE3XXREQ27I334BJK2CTMG4A6UNA,True,55,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

I looked on the internet and it appears this is a major issue for Beats headphones and there is no way to fix it. Normally, I would say well sometimes things break. However, this is the second pair of Beats noise canceling headphones my son has had with the exact same issue. The first pair lasted a little longer, but he bought those with his own money. These headphone are too expensive to be breaking all the time. I expect better quality control from an expensive set of headphone. I will not be buying another pair of Beats headphones ever!

RNKST26GTRHD4,B085296FLT,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid ANC heaphones, at the right price",Mike Jankowski,4,"Update 9/17/2022: After I wrote the review I found that on Android there are EQ apps that will help tune headphones to help them sound better. I personally use Wavelet now and with that these do sound really good now and clear up some of my criticisms about the sound in the original review. That being said, I can't find anything similar for iOS, so keep that in mind!I'll mention first that I didn't buy these headphones at full price, or anything close to it. At their original MSRP ($350) look elsewhere and don't look back, these get blown away by Sony and Bose and others at that price point. Once you get down to about $200 though? These start to look more tempting.I already have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's which have amazing sound, but no ANC, so they're great for around the house, but I needed a pair with ANC for work travel, so I took a chance on the Beats on a sale, and at a sale price, I'm pretty happy with them.The sound isn't bad, I know I've heard other people say there isn't a whole lot of bass. It does seem like that varies heavily from song to song, some give a nice, but never muddy, thump, others do feel a little lacking. Highs are pretty nice and crisp and come through well, it's the mids on these headphones that tend to be a bit muddled. It's by no means bad, but I'm also comparing it to some pretty good can headphones in roughly the same price range and the Audio Technica's win hands down there.ANC is probably the best feature of the headphones. It does a great job of keeping out engine noise when flying. Sony and Bose will do better at the Beats original price point, but at a sale price they do a very good job. You will run into a few weird quirks of it, for example I could hear it fighting the noise of a rough road while on a rental car shuttle which made for an interesting effect, but largely it just works and keeps out the noise well.Battery life seems to be pretty much what they're rated for, so no complaints there and the build quality seems solid. When using the controls, you will hear a clicking sound from the press, which I know some people have criticized. But, despite that, the controls are easy and intuitive. The look of them is pretty nice as well, but it would be nice if the ear cups to rotate to be flat on your chest, but that's a minor nitpick.Finally, the great irony, these actually seem to work better on my personal Pixel phone than my work iPhone, despite being an Apple product. The Android Beats app allows for better control of the headphones and the ANC, not to mention actually giving you a battery percentage as opposed to just a circle that gives you an approximate value. And with the Beats app installed, the pairing process was just as easy on my Pixel as it was for my work phone.Overall, they're solid headphones, but wait to catch them at the right price.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AF7GBXJT26ZTDSSQHDYSLC6KFJ6Q,True,126,Color: WhiteSet: Studio3

R1ZIS9GF8Z8EGP,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet the world without sacrificing the Music’s quality! Amazing sound, features & Alexa enabled!",A. Clark Fine Art,5,"The noise cancellation is exceptional on these headphones. With 10 levels I can block out most of what is going on around me, when it is safe to do so. If you are someone that startles easily, like myself, you will probably get scared a lot because you will not hear what or who is walking up behind you. My husband finds this very humorous.The sound quality was every bit of what I expected from Bose. Crisp, rich audio, with an amazing range of clarity, from your treble to mid tones and excellent bass. It’s easy to slip into your own little oasis with these on.They are also quite comfortable, their padded band and ear cups are soft and do not apple much pressure against your head. They are very light weight and I can wear them for hours without issue.The included case is well made, sturdy and not overly bulky allowing my to pack it and take it with me anywhere. It has a storage compartment for your cables so you always know where they are.The battery life is excellent! I can go days without charging, but if I do need to charge, they replenish quite quickly and I am right back in business. I have easily gotten a full 20 hour charge out of these. I like that when you turn them on they immediately tell you how many hours they have left on their current charge and what devices they are connected to. This makes it easy to check how long you can use them on their current charge, before you head out somewhere where you might not have access to a plug. I found the time they tell me I have left on my charge to be quite accurate. I am able to connect to more than one device (like my iPhone and iPad) and they intuitively play the sound from the device I am using at the moment. I love that feature it’s easy to switch from watching something on my iPad to listening to music from my phone. Bose also includes a cable so you can plug directly to your device and go wired. I have not used this feature because the battery life is so long, I have not run into a situation where it was necessary.The buttons and touch features of these headphones are wonderful. I can turn Alexa (Siri or Google) on or off depending on my needs. I can control the volume sliding my finger up or down on the surface of one ear and can tap to pause and swipe to change songs. With one button I can rotate between 3 levels of noise cancellation that I can set within my app. I have not had the chance to utilize some of the AR on these yet but cannot wait to try it on our next vacation, it will be like bringing along our own tour guide.I love that Alexa is built in. I’m an artist and when I’m painting in my studio it is very nice to be able to use Alexa to change my music without needing to touch my device or my headphones.I saved and waited to get these after trying them and comparing to the Sony competitive model and I am so glad I did. I found the bass of the Sony WH1000 series to be a little scratchy sounding and the overall sound just wasn’t as crisp as the Bose 700 series. I had a pair of Cowin E-7s and those, while they were great at their price point and did the job while I was saving up for these, they just weren’t even in the same class as the Bose 700. These, in my opinion (and I spent a lot of time putting headphones on and off, listening to how everything sounded on each), set the bar and everything else is just trying to measure up. Only the Sony WH1000 series could come close, but for me their sound quality still fell short. The only way to describe it was, you knew you were listening to a recording, whereas the sound from the Bose 700, you could close your eyes and it sounded like you were listening to it actually being played by the artist live the sound is just that crisp and clear no echo or scratch it’s clear vibrant and rich, everything I expected from Bose.I am very happy with my purchase, they were worth the wait and I would certainly recommend them to everyone!One Note I have very sensitive sinuses and when I put on noise canceling headphones, I can actually feel a pressure in my ears and sinus cavities, this does happen with the Bose as well (it happens with every brand I have tried if the cancellation is of any really quality). That said it does not deter me, nor do I feel it’s would be a reason I wouldn’t recommend them or give them a lower star rating. I can feel it when I activate the noise cancellation at its max level but everyone else I have asked to try them, can’t. So chances are very likely this will not be something that the average person even realizes. I can still use the noise cancellation and can block out enough that I never hear my husband walk into my studio until he taps me on the shoulder and scared the heck out of me. I only include this info in case there are others out there that also experience this, with the Bose 700 you can control the levels and it’s easy to step your way up through 10 levels of cancellation and find one that blocks the noise out, while still being comfortable to your sinuses. That is why I would recommend to everyone! Other headphones are cancellation on or off and if you are sensitive to it that can render the feature useless. Again not the case with the Bose 700 series. I use this feature all the time, have found the level that is perfect for me and the noise cancellation is amazing. It is so nice to finally be able to use this feature.I will also add that unlike other headphones the noise cancellation does not affect the quality of the sound I am listening to either! I have tried many where the sound completely changes the moment you turn it on, not with these. The sound remains crisp and rich and clear as it did without the noise cancellation. The only difference is the world around you gets quieter and the music sounds amazing! If you read this whole review Thank You if you are considering these headphones and trying to compare, in my opinion there is no comparison and I don’t think you will be disappointed choosing the Bose 700 series. I hope this info helped.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2020",AGR7CSKHU5EJ7UXLHEE7NABIXTYQ,True,362,Color: Black
R15CPIQJP7FJYE,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G.,Robby Bershow,5,"Bottom Line Up Front: These are great, fantastic, awesome, and a bunch of other words. The sound is fantastic, the ANC blocks out almost everything (in a normal and some not so normal environments), the mics do a fantastic job picking out only my voice on calls, the battery life is good, range is great, and (biggest surprise of all) the app works!Rest of the Story: I rushed to find a new headset after coming home and finding my JBLs lying on the floor in a state of repose that let me know that my toddler had done his worst. No amount of resuscitation worked; they were gone. Quickly cycling through the stages of grief, I set off to find a new respite from the constant cacophony that accompanies the child since I needed to have a sanctuary of calm and also a way to join calls without people informing me constantly about background noise.Read a bunch of reviews and guides; many people seem to have very particular tastes surrounding their very detailed preferences in sound quality, how the headphones look (because apparently one can improve their appearance wearing over-ear headphones), and any number of non-sensical comparisons. Here's my key features that I imagine are the most important to an average human just looking for a tool to get the job done:1. ANC works well within reasonable expectations of what is possible at a price point less than a used car2. Mic filters out unwanted noise while picking up my/your voice well3. Good battery life so it doesn't have to be ritually charged every day4. Connections to devices are easy and consistent5. Comfortable to wear for long periods6. Doesn't break the bank and, preferably, is a value7. Durable (see toddler comment)8. Sounds good9. Easy to useLet's explore:1. The ANC works very well and maybe too well. I was chastised because my wife was talking to me and stated a question multiple times before shouting at me and then I barely heard her from 5 feet away. It easily blocks out normal frequencies of everyday life, however, the piercing shrieks of small humans chasing a dog will still cut through a little bit. The levels are very adjustable, but I like my fortress of solitude so I choose to leave it at max and deal with the consequences.2. I asked several people on calls using Teams, cellphone, and Zoom if they could hear the chaos ensuing around me and it was reported that they could not hear anything other than me, although it did sound a little different than normal. Call it a win. I will add that the self voice feature is nice so I can hear myself speaking an a little bit of what is going on around me when on a call. Off the call, we are back to the fortress.3. It claims to have 20 hours of battery life and ever so nicely informs me of the state of charge in hours when turning the headphones on. I have not tried to listen for 20 hours straight because that is silly, but I can say that I used these on-and-off for a week without charging and, during that week, used them for multiple hours each day. I'd say that is pretty good and no need to compare further.4. These will maintain a connection to two devices at once and my most common use to was have them connected to the computer and phone simultaneously. It maintains a solid connection to both and I can hear music on one and get notifications on the other. If I am listening to music from the computer and a call comes in, it seamlessly switches to the phone. Hang up the call and the paused computer music picks back up. Switching to another device is easy using the (wait for it) Bose app that actually works! I could never get the JBL app to work right and I would have to disconnect from the work computer and then go into bluetooth settings on another to connect. The range, for me, was anywhere in the house; only had cut out when I went into the garage on the other side of a metal door and metal wall. I almost forgot: When turning them on, it tells you which two devices it connected to which is super nice if you have them set up for several possible connections.5. These are comfortable to wear all day if need be. The headband and ear cup foam are squishy yet supportive. I had no issue wearing these in a normal setting. Of course you will have sweaty ears if it hot outside and wearing these or if working out; duh. I saw someone talking about wearing these to weedeat; not the right application and people make devices with an actual NRR rating for that application. For normal uses, these are going to treat you well.6. These are a high performing audio piece of equipment and the price actually doesn't reflect that when compared to what else is out there. Sure, they aren't cheap, but quality does come at a cost. I would say that, when compared to it's peers that I'm sure you will find doing your own research, these are a relative value.7. These were probably never designed for wet environments so don't put them there (some reviews talk about this as a con). Otherwise, these feel solid and are constructed well. The phones slide down the bar rather than the bar extending; I think this is a good design feature that will make them last longer over all due to less moving parts and also keeps them set up correctly. The toddler has already attempted to replicate his earlier feat, but the Bose held it's own. To increase the protection of your investment, Bose has seen fit to include a hard case for travel/toddlers.8. Ultimately, you want a nice piece of audio equipment to sound nice; these do. They really, really do. I listened to my favorites on Spotify that I had heard a hundred times and picked up details I hadn't heard in songs before. Use the app that somehow actually works to adjust to your liking. I don't think these were engineered to blow out eardrums, but you can get a great bass thump if that is what you want. Overall, you won't be unhappy with the sound quality unless you are really looking to be unhappy with the sound quality.9. This one is maybe a bit nuanced; I think they are easy to use with the buttons and the swipe controls, but you might disagree. Some of it can be tailored in the app, but some of it will take a little getting used to. I do like having less physical buttons as opposed to more because I would inadvertently hit a button taking them off or putting on or I would fumble around for a button trying to do something simple like skip a song.Ultimately, my theme is function over form and these deliver on function. I am very pleased with the package Bose put together here and I think you will be too.","Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2023",AEWM4UY3QB6YNT3P5RKR62RUSOXQ,True,28,Color: Black
R16JB0IDA2TBD8,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Tons of great features which keep the headphones around your ears.... but for how long?,M. Greenberg,5,"I've owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I'm an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don't consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears.The sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced.A test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems (""I'm sorry, I didn't get that, who would you like to call? I don't know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing..."" _sigh_) which I don't believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee's voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you're not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset.A few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful.- the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that's a reasonable expectation or not.- the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard.Overall summary:A pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make.As a user which ""babies"" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a ""5"" setting more often than a ""10"" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of ""air"" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life ""appears"" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as ""hours of use"" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose).","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2019",AFNPMOFXKDZE25GWBXZVB5CWBFYA,True,135,Color: Black
RBX1DH9DN58AS,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredibly More Comfortable and User Friendly than all the Sony’s,Jenna May,5,"I decided to buy 4 sets of Noise Cancelling headphones and then send back the 3 loser (with the intention of giving objective feedback).***My primary priorities were noise cancellation and comfort. My secondary priorities were sound quality and user friendliness. And finally style.The four headphones that I compared were...Bose 700’sSony WH1000XM4’sBose 350’sSony WH1000XM3’sIn short, I ended up keeping the Bose 700s (and that was an easy decision based on my priorities).I have a little bit of bigger head and found the 700s much more comfortable than any of the others...by far! My wife has a smaller head and she tried the 700s and found that they didn’t fit her head well and preferred the Sony XM4s. However I can wear the Bose 700s for multiple hours and they feel great!!!I found the noise Cancellation to be equal in quality with the Bose 700s and the Sony XM4s. But I found the Sony XM4s to create a slight uncomfortable noise/feeling. Some people could find this troubling but it wasn’t a big deal for me.I found the Bose 700s and Sony XM4s have slightly better ability for noise cancellation than the Bose 350s and the Sony XM 3’s. However the Bose 700’s allow me to push a button to 3 different noise cancelling settings which is kind of nice.When it comes to sound quality the Sony XM4’s win by a long shot. And if I were only going to wear these for a few hours I would probably have bought the Sony XM4s. However I tend to travel internationally on flights that are 8+ hours long and so the comfort was more significant than the sound quality because the Bose 700s are still very good in their sound quality and I can adjust the EQ to my preference.The final decision maker for me was the user friendliness. The Bose 700s were so easy to set up and use. (This is also why I prefer apple products...simplicity). I found the Sony’s to be much more complicated, confusing and the touch sensors to be a bit clumsy and less responsive. I also found the Bose 700’s very easy to quickly put away in their storage case (which is a nice hard case for travel).The Bose 350s were also very simple to use and the sound quality was decent. But their comfort and noise cancelling was lesser than the Sony XM4S and the Bose 700s.The Sony XM3s are once again better in sound quality and between the Sony XM3s and the Bose 350s I would go with the Sony XM3s. Both fit on my head similarly...so equally uncomfortable for long term wear (great for my wife with a smaller head but not me with a bigger head).Obviously I’m not considering price in any of these comparisons. Because comfort was a much bigger priority to me than price...I needed something that would be worn comfortably for multiple hours despite the cost. If you’re looking for cost effectiveness the Sony XM3s or Bose 350s are the way to go (so long as they fit your head like they do my wife’s)For perspective my head is 23 inches round. My wife’s head is 20 inches. Our ears are average/not big so our ears fit just fine in all of the headphones listed above.When it comes to style the Bose 700s are incredibly sleek and modern...very stylish...especially the grey ones (which is what I bought). We found the grey Bose 700’s and Bose 350’s are much better looking than the Sony XM4 or XM3s. In fact I found the black Sony’s the only color I’d consider. So if color is something you’re considering and you want something besides black then both sets of the Bose are the way to go. But the 700’s take it to a whole new stratosphere and my teenage daughter wants to wear them (but they’re not leaving my head and I don’t think they would fit her very well as she has a similar size head as my wife). If I were buying some for her, I’d buy the grey Bose 350’s.Finally all of these have relatively strong batteries. The Sony’s are probably better overall but the Bose 700’s charge quickly and I can easily get 20+ hours of listening out of them before needing to charge them. Fifteen minutes of charging will get me a few hours.Let me be clear, all 4 of these headphones are REALLY nice! And so you need to consider your priorities and then choose accordingly and I think you will then be happy with whatever route you go.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020",AF5MZAGDLIB4RO72FX2S5F3YUGRA,True,79,Color: Silver Luxe
R3BW6NTUT6GTYF,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great NC and wireless, a few gripes",Jordan J,4,"I received these a few weeks ago and feel an appropriate amount of time, activities, and use of the 700s has been had for a review.The build quality is very nice. I typically use these everyday for long periods of time and they are sturdy with no signs of wear. They are comfortable enough when worn appropriately. I have a habit of uncupping one ear instead of turning NC to 0 which can lead to discomfort around the ears and top of the head. This is no fault of the product however. The buttons and controls work well with iOS, Siri, and Alexa in my experience. Playback controls on PC do not always work as seamlessly, with skip often not working in some applications.Noise cancellation is as good as it gets. Not much to expound upon, if this is the most important feature for you, fret not.In addition to great NC, the call quality is worth mentioning because it may be the 700's most outstanding feature. I've had calls with distraction level noise disturbances in my vicinity and clarity is just as good, if not better, than my iPhone's default mic. You can also tune how much of your voice comes through to your ears to make conversation feel more natural.I'll use this feature to segue into the Bluetooth functionality, the Bose music app, and use on a non-mobile device.Connecting to two devices at once works surprisingly well. It's very easy to get audio from the source I want with a simple pause x, play y. Range in my house is almost unbelievable, I haven't tested it's limits but clear across my house through the drywall I'm still connected.The Bose music app for iOS is atrocious. When it works it's great, but on a consistent and frequent basis I have to kill the app and restart to avoid a totally pointless login screen. If that isn't the issue, the app often doesn't acknowledge that the phone is paired with the headphones despite them actively streaming audio from the device. This has caused me to re-pair the headphones with the app on occasion which is annoying. Even when working properly the app is sluggish and seems unresponsive.You can customize how long the headphones remain on when no audio is transmitted to the headphones in addition to a lack of motion (though they have still shut off on me despite motion). Bose claims a battery life of 20 hours, my app consistently reports 17.5 hours on a full charge. If you charge it at night or once a day, it's really not an issue even with all-day use.Sound quality is perfectly fine for the average user. If you're looking for studio level audio clarity, I'm not sure why you are reading this review. These are wireless NC headphones, and the sound quality great for that purpose. They don't get as loud as normal headphones, which is kind-of the point of NC. Bass can feel muted if you're used to heavy bass, but bass heavy music sounds fine to me and is probably a more subjective issue.Overall, if you want top quality NC headphones and have the $400 to shell out, go for it. If you're upgrading from other NC headphones it may not be worth the money, maybe test them out at a Bose store or wherever they are sold retail. The app functionality really needs to be addressed so maybe wait to see if Bose can ameliorate the problems if you already have headphones. If making and receiving calls is your main use case these are a safe purchase.I will update if anything changes.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2019",AEDSSNSRFQBDP5QOFAO4W6P6LA5A,True,8,Color: Black
R24FAAZHB4ASS3,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable quality bluetooth headphone,Tara,5,"This headphone is one of the most comfortable I've ever put on my head. I can easily wear it all day (16 hours straight) without getting a headache despite being migraine prone. The weight of the headphone is barely noticeable, and it's easy to adjust the fit. The sound quality is exactly what you'd expect from BOSE. Installing the BOSE app just means being able to customize the equalizer to your preference (among other things), but it's not a requirement. The noise cancellation feature is awesome, and it can also be customized via the app. And I can't rave enough about the way the noise cancelation feature works with the mic.I've been using my headphone daily for over a year, and I still have no battery life issues. I can count with one hand the number of times I end my day with no charge left in my headphone.It did take a small learning curve to figure out how to use the headphone, but it's a small trade-off to all the conveniences and values of this headphone.Overall, although the BOSE headphone is a bit on the pricey side, it's definitely worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AG7VSWGILSYRXQWJ5MYMD2FQJ5VA,True,1,Color: Black
ROJWAM02GVDYW,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones option for remote workers with Unified Communication USB connector,Andrew,5,"I have owned/used the Jabra Evolve 75 for 4 years. I have owned and used this Bose product exclusively for ~2 months. I bought it to replace my Evolve when the boom mic stopped muting the headset.I work from home full time and use them 3-6 hours a day. I'll compare the two products a bit here for people who might be familiar with that one.In short: It's a really nice headset, albeit one with some quirks. If you want a single headset for work and music, get the Bose NC 700 (with UC if you also use a supported team meeting product, like MS Teams). If you want a headset for work only then you should also consider/compare the Jabra Evolve 75PROS:- Extremely comfortable when the room you are in is at a comfortable temperature,- Quite comfortable for people who wear glasses. The Evolve 75 was less comfortable with glasses due, I believe, because of the design: the Bose fits around your ear and the Evolve 75 sits on top of your ear, which would push it into the glasses and your head. Never a huge deal, but one thing I noticed with them after hours of use wear- With UC connector (sold separately or as a bundle with headphone), the controls work with a couple of the leading video conferencing products- Noise canceling is incredible...absolutely fantastic.- A pleasant voice and sounds telling you what is going on when you hit most of the controls. The Evolve 75 has voice feedback as well- Charges very quickly...30 minutes will get me through my work day- Music sounds wonderful on them. I would not use the Evolve 75 for music if I had other options around like thisCONS:- When your room is hot the Bose is not as comfortable as the Evolve 75. I think this is because the Bose encases your ears while the Evolve sits more on top of the ear- I find the touchpad controls much less accurate than physical button. Hold the touchpad for the right amount of time to mute/unmute means I'm wrong some amount of the time. The Evolve 75 was way more simple...move the mic boom up and you are muted, move it down and you are not- The manual is not very good. Did you know that the UC USB nub has a button to set bluetooth to discovery mode? The manual doesn't tell you that and the button is so well placed and designed that it doesn't look like a button at all- The software to update/use the Bose it is awkward at best. Jabra's software updater is much cleaner- Does not come with a stand to put it when not in use. The Evolve 75- If you want Unified Communications you need to buy a $75 USB nub, or buy the NC 700 UC package. The Evolve 75 has it all in one package/price- When paired to your phone and your computer (via UC nub) it gets confused when you get a phone call while on a work meeting. I tend to disconnect it from my phone during working hours for this reason...the Evolve 75 handled two devices better- Uses a very different cable to charge...sort of like a hollowed-out USB-C...and the supplied cable is so short you cannot charge and use the headset at the same time. The Evolve 75 can be charged and used a the same time easily...if you ever even had to do this, as the stand it comes with will charge the phone as well if its plugged into a USB portNEUTRAL:- Battery life is satisfactory...I go a couple days between charges- A bit higher price than the Evolve 75- I found the Evolve 75 to have better signal range","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2021",AGU7CAMNO6S2Y3CHIZ5BGDDOT65A,True,8,Color: Black
R197DHP87C93CG,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Awful,Jason Brannock,1,"I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.Microphone and PlaybackThe B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileE285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandBose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantCouldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleWhile the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesB700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,127,Color: Silver Luxe
R3AH4ZU7UTBZJ3,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Non-Biased Review of Beats vs Sony WH-1000MX3 / WH-1000MX4 vs Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700,Dave & Laura,4,"This review is my personal experience using both headphones. I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones. Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic). Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.PERSONAL USAGEI use these headphones primarily for work. I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development. I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work. We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication. Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.PERSONAL PREFERENCESI really don’t like using in the ear headphones. They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution. Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me. This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEADMy first pair of headphones were Beats Solo. I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general. Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3. These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.The functionality is about the same between the two. With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements. Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.• Pros – Lots of colors. Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity. Useful when sweating or outdoor use.• Cons – Quality. Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution. Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general. Feel cheap.FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member. I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted. I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality. Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more. My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time. The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s. One big thing I would like to see is app integration. Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature. Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two. I found I used it a couple of times.Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1. These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.• Pros –Very durable and well built. Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work. Slept with these on a bus trip. That was my last memory. Cheaper than the Bose. Foldable, smaller case.• Cons – Less features than the Bose. Misses on some sweet spots. Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible. Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t. The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute. When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up. Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.I’ve only had these for a month. Was it worth paying up for it? Honestly, I don’t know yet. There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.So based on a month, here’s what I found• Pros – Seems like better sound quality. More features and possible mute integration.• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.TLDR / OVERALL REVIEWI won’t even compare the Beats headphones. Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.METRICS• Sound Quality – Bose slightly. My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be. Spotify is what I listen to primarily. The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.• Mute / Unmute – Bose. The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose. There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10. Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.• Microphone – Sony. Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”. Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about. Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy. I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony. It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary. If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.• Headset Features, Bose wins. Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them. The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.• Headset Quality – Sony. I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head. Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t. An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.• In the box – Sony slightly. Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not. I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony. Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively. Bluetooth location hasn’t changed. Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.• Companion Application – Bose. Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.WINNER – SonyI’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone. Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective. So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again. Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that. Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire. That’s something that’s a no-go for me. I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement. Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it. I can see it both ways. For me, these headphones are for basic usage. The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade. Defective products happen. I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better. Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.I hope this helped someone. Sorry for too much text.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2022",AGSFQWOSK6X7AP2QTQXUJCSFG5EA,True,1034,Color: Black
R2GUYB5T515UTB,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Concert Hall Quality Music,Thomas Walker,5,"I must immediately confess that my 5 Star rating pertains to one of 2 headsets. I'd been sold on the 700C by the Consumer Reports write up. As promised, finding one was challenging. Luckily, I found 2 pair for sale by Frontrow Tech LLC through Amazon that could be delivered quickly; important because I wanted them for forthcoming air travel my wife and I would take.The headphones arrived on schedule. I plugged the first ones in and - nothing. None of the trouble shooting steps I found on the Bose website helped. I plugged the 2nd pair in and, voila, signs of charging commenced. Once that finished I turned them on and paired them easily with my jukebox (phone). The musical reproduction was stunning. What's more, noise canceling levels are adjustable, so you can choose on that still allows diminished outside noise for situations when monitoring the exterior environment remains important.As to the defective pair, we were leaving on our trip the day after they arrived, so there would be no time to address the issue until our return. Once back home, I contacted Frontrow Tech through Amazon, who asked if I needed a return label. I replied ""yes,"" but also that I didn't just want to return the pair, I wanted to replace them. To my great disappointment, they'd had only the ones I'd bought. New ones elsewhere? Hens' teeth. Still, the working set amply validated CR's praise. Frontrow couldn't replace them, but handled the transactions promptly and professionally.I'm awaiting receipt now of a professionally refurbished pair from another supplier. I'm optimistic they'll work well.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AFGMQ5UUJCWNZ6RFOU64LOY5UZKQ,True,0,Color: Black
R2O11NGJEXBTK0,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Work Headphones + Audio Bliss,Sam,5,"As an avid audiophile always on the lookout for top-notch sound quality and cutting-edge features, I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the Bose Headphones 700. Renowned for their noise-canceling capabilities, Bluetooth connectivity, and integrated microphone, these over-ear wireless headphones offer a premium audio experience. In this in-depth review, I'll delve into the key features, my impressions, and what sets the Bose 700 apart in the competitive realm of high-end headphones.Audio Quality:Bose has a well-established reputation for delivering exceptional audio quality, and the Headphones 700 live up to this legacy. The sound is rich, detailed, and immersive, offering a balanced audio profile suitable for various genres. Whether you're listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the clarity and depth of the audio elevate the overall listening experience.Noise Cancelling Excellence:The standout feature of the Bose 700 is undoubtedly its noise-canceling capability. The advanced technology used in these headphones effectively blocks out ambient noise, creating a cocoon of silence for an unparalleled audio experience. Whether you're commuting, working in a bustling office, or just seeking solace, the noise-canceling feature on these headphones is nothing short of impressive.Bluetooth Connectivity:The wireless connectivity of the Bose 700 ensures freedom of movement without compromising on audio quality. Setting up Bluetooth pairing is a breeze, and the headphones maintain a stable connection even at a distance. The absence of tangled cords adds to the overall convenience, making these headphones an excellent choice for those who prioritize a wireless lifestyle.Clear Calls and Voice Control:One of the standout features of the Bose 700 is its built-in microphone, designed to provide crystal-clear calls. The adaptive four-microphone system effectively isolates your voice from background noise, ensuring that your calls are clear and professional. Additionally, the integration of voice control, including support for Alexa, adds a layer of convenience for hands-free operation.Comfortable Design:The over-ear design of the Bose 700 is not only aesthetically pleasing but also comfortable for extended use. The ear cushions are plush and provide a secure fit without causing discomfort. The headband is adjustable, accommodating various head sizes, and the overall construction is sturdy yet lightweight.Intuitive Touch Controls:Navigating through your music, adjusting volume, or taking calls is a breeze with the intuitive touch controls on the earcups. The responsive touch-sensitive surface allows for effortless control, adding a touch of sophistication to the overall user experience.Minor Cons: Fit SensationWhile the Bose Headphones 700 excel in many aspects, it's worth noting a minor consideration regarding the fit sensation. Some users may find that the over-ear design results in a somewhat looser fit than expected. While the plush ear cushions provide comfort, the fit might not be as snug as some users prefer. This is a subjective matter, and individuals with smaller head sizes may experience a slightly looser fit. However, it's important to highlight that the overall comfort is not compromised, and the adjustable headband still ensures a secure fit for most users. If a more secure fit is a priority, potential buyers may want to try the headphones on before making a purchase decision. Despite this minor consideration, the Bose Headphones 700 deliver an exceptional audio experience that outweighs this subtle fit sensation for many users.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Bose Headphones 700 stand as a testament to Bose's commitment to audio excellence and innovation. From the immersive sound quality and industry-leading noise-canceling capabilities to the seamless Bluetooth connectivity and intuitive controls, these headphones redefine the standards for premium audio devices. Whether you're a music enthusiast, frequent traveler, or professional seeking a top-tier communication tool, the Bose Headphones 700 deliver an unparalleled audio journey that is sure to satisfy even the most discerning listeners.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGDNGKHLMFISCT7NB2ZSTN4TLSVA,True,1,Color: Black
R1RUP3JGD9Z8F0,B07Q9MJKBV,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Terrible Software",Larry,2,"*Introduction:I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:*Noise Cancelling:When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the ""punch"" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.*Sound Quality:Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how ""good"" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush. I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.*Design / Comfort:This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious. As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.*Battery life:They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.*Touch controls:Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.*Bose Music App:This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.*Headphone Software:The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality.

R2CYY3DK4QPJOL,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Rehoming Bose 700 NC,David C.,5,"TL<>DR: They came with no damage and worked as expected with a 45% discount over brand new.I purchased my Bose 700 NC (black) as a used product and have always had great luck with refurbished and used products in the past.The level of engagement from the seller was great. They contact me to ensure I understood what I am buying and how it is going to arrive. It came off as a red flag when they replied to my reply. Came across as they are trying to convince me to not purchase the headphones. Ultimately, they have likely had issues with scams or illiterate customers.The headphones came in a tyvek bubble mailer via USPS. We recorded the opening, again I was worried with the level of outreach from the seller, and found no defects on the headphone case. Everything that comes with a Bose 700 was inside the case with no damage on the inside. The headphone have no physical defects and charged as expected.Read through the user manual and tested the volume up/down, skip/go back, the 0,5,&10 NC settings. We used YouTube Premium music and other audio types to test the audio. The quality is better than anything else I own and expect as much for the best rated NC headphones by Consumer Report.Testing the NC, I used the bubble mailer to generate sound and it is very obvious the noise cancellation works flawlessly. If a person uses loud voice you can still understand what is said, but normal communication at five feet apart and you can guess what is being said, if they look at you.The Bose app is rubbish, though. It recognizes my headphones and connects them to my Bluetooth, but they do not appear in the app for being able to change the settings. This is not a big issue as everything I need are already on the headphones.These were bought for when I travel to have headphones that do not roll around the plane if they fall out. But more importantly when a person takes a captive audience and yells for four hours in order for the person two chairs over to hear them.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AG2QBI3YID3DHM5LV6I7B2ZBYJJA,True,1,Color: Black

So, I know good sound - but keep in mind the ""many many"" part of it, as my hearing is likely not as good as it was 40 years ago. That said, for my use, these cans are great! I got them to be able to listen while I'm at work, shutting out the surrounding noise. They have a fairly flat response - not a strong bass, but in my opinion, most over emphasize bass, where I want realistic bass, which is what I get here. The noise cancelling is great - I use them while I'm vacuuming, and hardly hear the vacuum at all, right in front of me.

R1KCO78K6DA1GK,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Top notch noise cancellation headphone,Mark,5,"I’ve had the Bose 700s for 5 months and have been impressed with their all around performance. Now that the headphones have an update to add an equalizer they are tough to beat!Pros:Outstanding noise cancellationAdjustable noise cancellationNew equalizer featureExcellent audio performanceExcellent call performanceExcellent comfortAbility to connect to 2 devices at onceDecent battery lifeSleek modern looksCons:Bose Music app can be flakyOccasional break up of noise cancellation with extreme sounds.Not rated for water resistance at allToo expensive at regular priceBattery lasts for me about 8 days before I get to 20% battery remaining and I have a long commute. From a practical standpoint 20 hours is plenty. The battery indicator is pretty accurate at providing the remaining hours left although somehow it never gets past 19 hours at full charge. They fully charge in 2 1/2 to 3 hours which is as advertised.Great noise cancellation. Overall works the noise cancellation works well on a commuter train. Also good at blocking background noise in open space office. I've used it when doing yard work and it does a great job of saving your ears from power tools. It can’t block out everything but no headphones can. There is occasional leakage of voices from the side and back when someone is talking right next to you. It is best at blocking sounds from the front. I have noticed an occasional break up of the noise cancellation with some sounds such as loud jet engine during take off or with certain lawn tools but that is pretty rare. The adjustable noise cancellation is awesome since there are times I want to hear my surroundings like when I’m walking on city streets or need to make sure I am not making a lot of noise with headphones on when I’m at home.Another strong point is the call quality. People can hear me clearly during calls and you can adjust how loud your own voice sounds on the calls as well which is a nice touch. The 700s do a great job too of blocking out ambient sounds during calls when you are speaking.The Bluetooth connection is excellent especially with Apple products. Another plus is ability to connect to 2 devices at same time. Great for use of laptop and phone. Pairs easily with my Windows 10 HP laptop. Automatically switches audio to the active device. Also nice job of switching when you get a call on your phone.It remembers every device its connected to and automatically connects without pairing which is awesome. It did have hiccoughs sometimes not picking up your voice on video conference calls with Zoom and Webex but these have been resolved with the latest firmware update.Comfort is excellent. I was a little worried with them since I wear glasses but did not find that to be a problem. They do not get hot or uncomfortable when you wear them for several hours at a time.The ear cup touch controls work great. I can attest that they work fine in cold weather in below freezing temperatures in Chicago. They only get sensitive if they get wet. Sadly they aren’t even water resistant so take care wearing them in the rain.The Bose Music app works most of the time but has its glitchy moments. Occasionally it won't find my headphones even though they are paired and connected to my phone (the headphones still work fine even when to app doesn’t connect). Also sometimes the Music App doesn't successfully update the headphone software.I did an informal comparison between the Bose and the Sony WH-1000XM3 Noise cancellation was pretty comparable. I found the Sony’s too boomy in bass for me at standard settings. I prefer a more balanced sound the Bose provides. The 700s look way better than the Sony’s (and the QC 35s).This is not an audiophile quality headphone but for wireless noise cancellation the sound is excellent all things considered. Now that the latest firmware adds an equalizer you can FINALLY adjust the sound! The equalizer has bass mid and treble adjustments you access using the Bose music app and do make a difference in the sound quality. The 700s can create some thumping bass at max bass boost and likewise the treble and mid boost is substantial.So a few niggles but excellent in every other area. Highly recommended, especially when they are on sale!","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020",AE7OOPOQWCUNV3U7KFWABXT3YSTQ,True,30,Color: Black

R33VJOHEU1WGRN,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancellation. Wish the bass was clearer.,Jeffrey Imbody,4,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas, and she loves them! She let me try them, (only for a minute though, she wanted them right back). She works from home 2 days a week, and sometimes has to participate in conference calls, or just wants to work without hearing noise in the house.We have a dog. He barks, as dogs do, and he has a very loud and rather shrill bark. She has told me that when he barks, she can't hear him at all, and the noise filtering microphone, whereas it does not eliminate the sound of his barking completely, does a very good job of muting it so she doesn't have to explain our dog's behavior to her co-workers.I have not had a chance to play with the app, and my wife is not an app person, and has had some trouble making it work properly, but most of the functions of the headphones can be controlled on the unit, so she enjoys them very much as a stand-alone.I am a bit of an audiophile and a musician, and though I wish the bass response on these headphones was a bit more clear, (perhaps that can be adjusted with the app), I was amazed at the three-dimensional quality of the sound and the clarity of the digital signal in most ranges.I want a pair, but I am holding out for the quiet comfort ultra!! But if you are looking for headphones that are a bit more affordable and still have a great dynamic range and superior noise-cancelling, you can't go wrong with these!Having said all that, they look a little strange.

First, I was shocked to discover that Bose forces you to download their app to even make the headphones work at all - the headphones will not function at all without it. Good luck if you are in an area without a live internet connection. I was not happy having to do this, but I downloaded the app. I then found out that you are FORCED to open a Bose account or your new headphones will stay non-functional! Further, unless you agreed with their privacy policy, AND give your headphones full-time access to your microphone, AND allow your location history to be downloaded, etc., YOUR HEADPHONES ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL!!!

R1REMTV69YZ75J,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect Item,PATRICK,5,"The protein leather, earpieces, come apart @ about 3.5 years of ownership, based on my usage. Bose needs to improve these. Outside of that, it's a perfect item. This is my 2nd pair that I've owned. The previous one was obviously different & an older model, not as advanced tech. I had to get earpiece replacements for that pair. I might have to do that with this current pair if Amazon sells them. Or I might buy a new model pair or two because the technologies is better especially since there's been multiple years past. I can use one pair @ home and one pair @ work. It's cheaper if you buy a set of 2. Supposedly, Bose makes these better over a period of time. I use my current pair to listen to movies on YouTube, on my laptop. I live in an apartment and my laptop doesn't use loud enough volume. The movie is too pitchy so I can hear the entire dialogue of a movie by hearing using the headphones. It solves the problem. I'm thinking about wearing them @ work. I work in a manufacturing facility and we are allowed to wear to music as long as we do our work. It'll be cool if I use these @ work. I'll be the only one who use very expensive headphones with the best quality of listening to music and canceling noise.

R3O9UUB8H9746Y,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great, not comfortable, awkward controls",jeffp,3,"I'd had the Bose 700 in my amazon cart for a few months, and when I saw them marked down 25% during a labor day sale, I decided to purchase. I bought these primarily for the ANC to help with office noise at work, and loud neighbors at home. Unfortunately I suffer from misophonia.The good:The ANC works very well. It's a bit less effective than earplugs or earmuffs, but much more comfortable and breathable. Solely with ANC enabled, ambient noises are silenced completely. I can hear nearby conversations but not well enough to understand them. Neighbor noises (dogs) are still audible but usually not triggering. Earlier today, I used these headphones to make a phone call while standing between two very loud industrial HVAC units outdoors, not only was I able to easily understand the person I was talking to, they understood my end of the conversation as well. And if I'm listening to music, I can really observe the music and outside noises are not a distraction.I'm an audiophile, and music sounds wonderful on these compared to the $50 bluetooth earbuds I've been using for years. Listening to classic rock ""remasters"" on the Spotify app, I can hear details in the music that I thought were lost outside of listening to original release vinyls on a high quality sound system. I haven't even tried listening to high-fidelity audio sources yet, or tried using the included aux cable instead of bluetooth. I'm excited to experience those.The bad:A coworker owns the Bose QC45 headphones and allowed me to try them (the reason I originally became interested in Bose headphones), and the fit of the earpieces on those are much more comfortable than the 700's. Unfortunately the Bose 700 becomes very uncomfortable to wear after a few hours. The ANC of the QC45 seems equivalent to that of the 700. I didn't listen to any music on them so I can't compare that.My major complaints are with the minimal user interface and unhelpful (for me) options. There is a button on the left earcup to toggle the ANC, and on the right earcup there are buttons for power and voice assistant. By default the headphones give voice prompts when powered on or when buttons are pressed - this is very annoying for me. Voice prompts can disabled in the Bose app but by doing that the headphones will no longer tell me Caller ID information when I get a call, though fortunately the phone still rings. Unfortunately there is no way to disable or change the 'power on/off' sounds. A humble beep would be sufficient to let me know when the headphones are powered on and connected - I don't want or need to hear loud symphonic flourishes across the entire spectrum of human hearing to let me know when the headphones have connected to my phone.The Bose 700 has a ""gesture"" surface control on the right earcup for playback control instead of having dedicated playback buttons like the QC45. I don't like surface controls in general, and I expect the earcup's finish will start showing fingerprints and wear from daily volume adjustments etc in a short time.I am going to test these for a few more weeks and decide whether I want to keep them or exchange for the QC45.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2023",AHBJVBZDVOSVEAPQKD36VDEV5GPQ,True,3,Color: Black
RXJ8DOI2DGR56,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Ultimate headphones for business travelers,Eric,5,"If you want to skip my review then just read this. If you are a road warrior don't hesitate. BUY THESE HEADPHONES.I am very much a DIYer especially when it comes to home audio. This I would NEVER waste money on a speaker system from BOSE. I can taylor something far better for a space for less money than any Bose system. So spending $400 on a pair of headphones? No way.However, two months ago I was watching a Mark Robert video on YouTube and he took 5 minutes to do a plug on these headphones. He has always seemed like a very genuine guy but even I was a little skeptical of what he showed. He was using the headphones to take a phone call while leaf blowing. He recorded the audio from the other side of the line to showcase the person he was talking to couldn't hear the leaf blower at all. I was dumb founded and wanted to try it for myself.I travel 30 to 40 weeks out of the year. I'm constantly taking conference calls from busy restaurants and airports. Let alone can I not hear anything, the folks on the other side of the line can't hear me either. Then of course in annoying everyone in the space I'm in because I talk loudly to try and make up for it.The Bose 700s fix ALL OF THIS. My first try was in front of a bus stop at a busy airport. Waiting for a bus shuttle I took a conference call that I had to do a lot of talking on. The first thing I noticed is the noise cancelling let a little noise in. This allowed me to hear myself normally so I don't talk too loudly and disturb those around me. Next I could hear everyone on the call perfectly. Finally everyone on the call could hear me and hear none of the background noise. Literally nothing. They were shocked at the end of the call when I asked them how I sounded and they assumed I was at home in my office. I told them that in that time busses were whizzing by and people were yelling about which bus had arrived... They couldn't believe it.For that reason alone it is the best Bluetooth headset on the market.Now does it have the best noise cancellation? I think it could be better, but it's pretty near perfect. Other than really loud noises or high pitched sounds everything is blocked out. In fact I'm usually afraid I will fall asleep on the bus I take to the airport and miss my stop. The sound quality is fantastic and the battery life is great. I was worried seeing there are other brands offering 30 to 40 hours. I usually always have 10+ hours left after I get home from my trip and that's with no charging in between.Finally the controls are super intuitive. I was worried at first. These touch controls are always a gimmick. Then the amount of buttons on it too I was worried I wouldnt be able to figure it out and I would just never use the controls. In two days I had it down perfectly. Being able to easily skip tracks, turn down volume, pause music, and turn off noise cancelling is super useful.I'm sure you can find better head phones for music, better head phones for noise cancelling, or ones with better battery life. I guarantee you will not find ones better for taking phone calls that give you this incredible of an experience on top of it. These are clearly the best all around head phones and worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2019",AHNYLWTLJZSS4JVZ44WDUMX7SD7A,True,15,Color: Black

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I expected them to be on par with the Sony XM-5 headphones that I also own. The noise cancelling is probably 80% as good as the Sonys and the sound quality is close but is let down by a very lackluster app that gives you fewer tuning choices when compared to Sony's cluttered but otherwise excellent app. The build quality is probably a bit better than the XM-5 which seem to be step down in build quality from the previous XM iterations. I attribute this to sony playing the green card and trying to use all recycled materials for the XM-5s.

RZWXXJU3JEHX,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Noise Cancelling,Bert Cano,4,"I had a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones that I had owned for about a year and a half that started having issues with the noise cancelling so I decided to give these a shot. This review is largely a comparison between the two.NOISE CANCELLING: The noise cancelling is really good.I would say that the actual noise reduction is equal to the Sony's. However I noticed that when I was cutting my nails, the nail clippers clipping-sound induced an audible pop in the headphones, almost jarringly so. So it seems the headphones don't agree with any close, loud, sudden, and slightly higher frequency sounds. I've only had these for a few days, but it seems as though there is no way to turn the microphones *off* even if the ANC is set to zero. ANC on zero sounds like the microphones around the headphones are still picking up and emitting outside sounds. I could be wrong but it sounds that way to me. Other than those two nitpicks the noise cancelling is quite good.AUDIO QUALITY: Compared to the Sony's the audio quality is... okay.It sounds as though the stereo spectrum is quite narrower than the Sony's. If you're not sure what that means, imagine yourself listening to a piano. Imagine that piano being played in a hallway. Now imagine that piano being played in a concert hall. Bose = hallway, Sony = concert hall. It also sounds as though the frequency spectrum isn't quite as full. To me it also sounds as though the audio transmission between device and headphone is of lower quality. Its like max quality on these is 480p, while on the Sony's its 4k. I have to assume that the Sony's have better Bluetooth hardware? Idk.MULTIPLE DEVICES: Fast and seamless.Compared to the Sony's, the 700's ability to switch between devices is much faster and more seamless. No complaints here. The software to connect new devices is also easy to use.COMFORT: Very comfortable.I actually just realized I've been wearing these for about 4 hours straight and they haven't made me feel like I've needed to adjust them. The Sony's are also very comfortable but I felt like I had to adjust those on my head more. The 700's feel slightly lighter so that's probably why.OVERALL: Good.Probably not worth $400 honestly. If they were priced at $250-$300 I would say that that could appropriate. Don't get me wrong though these, so far, are great if you've never had a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 lmao. Saying that feels almost unfair lol but that's how I feel. The sound quality is just not amazing for $400. If you're coming from earbuds or something you might not notice, but these are $100 more than the Sony's right now and it seems as though the only thing they do better is switch between devices a second or two faster.I will keep these until Sony comes out with a new model and then get that and keep these as a backup.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2022",AEUKHADSHV2W3XSVATH6BHIWPT7Q,True,0,Color: Black
RM3BF76NRIU1X,B07Q9MJKBV,2.0 out of 5 stars OK headset with major flaws.,Caleb,2,"These are my work headphones I use in the office and while traveling. I've had them just under 2 months and I am already looking to spend my own money on new headphones to replace these. The sound is fine, the noise cancelling is really nice, the mic isn't good, but better than my previous set. They fit loose but very comfortable when sitting/standing upright and the ascetic style of this headset is pleasing. However, there are big issues that really degrade the experience.Because of how the earcups rotate and how you have to place headset on your head, you cannot use these headphones lying down on your back. The ear cups fold off your head and there is not enough resistance or a locking mechanism to hold them in place. I also mentioned that the headset is loose. For me personally, the band does not provide enough compression to sit snug on the head so when you move around, they tend to slip about too easily. As such, the seal of the earpads is tenuous, causing interruptions of the noise cancelling effect simply by turning your head too quick or you jog a bit to catch a train before the doors close.The touch controls on the headset are not the most responsive, but OK to use from time to time when needed. The buttons are terrible. They give very easily, meaning the slightest touch or even a brush against your coat collar can trigger it. The power button is a single press and not a press-and-hold, which leads to constant accidental power ons and offs when: handling them to put them on/away, while jostling in their case, and when adjusting the cups on your head. A dedicated power switch with some resistance to prevent accidental power on/offs would be much better. The problem here is the headset has an auto off function and you can change the time the headset stays on for. Some might utilize this feature, but I never do; personally, it's a hindrance. The mute button is right next to the power button so reaching for mute is a 70/30 chance you hit the right button. The only way you can tell you are muted/un-muted is a voice notification right when it happens, there are no LED or physical switch orientations to tell you otherwise.With there being two buttons, one on the left cup and one on the right cup, and having the touch zone on the earcup, you would think the required phone app would allow you a lot of customization...NOPE. You can customize one button and you have two options for it. That's it. The app is terrible and a huge contributor to why I dislike this headset. In order to connect the headset, you have to go through the app and I never know when it's actually connected. It will say I'm connected, but I get no audio and no mic. I can't simply disconnect and reconnect the headset through the phone settings, you have to use the app too. Then the headphones won't go into pairing mode and the app can't find them. It's incredibly annoying, especially when you need to connect for a meeting and the required software is impeding the hardware.You can name your headphones something to be identifiable in your device settings through the Bose app, which is nice when you have a big list of connected Bluetooth devices. However, you can't rename or give nicknames to the devices you are connected to in the Bose app. Every time I connect to my work computer, it spells out the long random PC name I can't change because my work controls. It also mutes the audio for everything you are connected to whenever the little notification voice pops up, so if something connects/disconnects or I mute my mic, I'm forced out of my conversation for a time, causing me to ask people to repeat themselves. I'm not 100% sure how it operates, but the headset can go into a sleep mode of sorts and a small beep tells you when it reconnects. Well some sites or programs I use cause it to ping almost non-stop which leads me to just turn the headset off.Also, does the battery last an 8hr workday? Yes. Does it last All-Day (14-16hrs)? Barely. It's about 20% battery for 2-3 hours, which will get worse with time. And you can't charge the headset while using it.Overall, it's just a frustrating experience that has room for improvement in a future model and some app updates. Once I find something that better suits my needs, I will shift the use of this headset to be only for desk duty, if not placed on a shelf or given to a co-worker.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2022",AHUSR2OZS5HK2WQTYNBT4CR7QMQQ,True,9,Color: Silver Luxe

R35U4IZQTFK4RC,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Product, Within Limits of Physics",Colin M. Shawhan,5,"I love the headphones! I barely heard a crying infant on a two hour flight to Salt Lake City. When I lifted one of the ear cups to test the NC the child, along with the background jet noise was louder. Was noise gone with the NC active? No, but the combine passive and active cancellation is impressive.Bose achieves a respectable reduction via the ear pads alone. They fit a bit tighter than some non-NC headphones but I believe this is a part of the equation. The ""old fashioned"" way of dealing with commuter noise was to crank up the volume, effectively listening to media at concert volume to drown out the outside world. That works but it's bad for your ears!Music sounds great, and if you want to crank it up the Bose 700's have plenty of volume. But if you are studying like I often do, or taking a private call then you can tune the voice to a comfortable volume and speech is intelligible. That's important for me as a business person and professional. If I have two hours to kill waiting for a connecting flight I am happy to crank up the tunes and shake my booty at the airport. Who cares? Dancing is better exercise than sitting in an awkward position fiddling with a smart phone.On to bass quality: for headphones? Pretty darn good. Bose 700's aren't professional gear, they are a high end consumer product: You get what you pay for. Can you buy $1,000 headphones? Sure. Are they better? A little. At this price point the 700's fit their niche.As an audio test, Dubstep sounded pretty amazing to me. I know what to expect from a good headphone and Bose delivers. Is the low end a bit of a psychoacoustic illusion? Yeah, but I know that. The 700's held at arms length will produce no audible bass. That's just not bass, period. But they sound bassy enough for me, and if you want license plate-rattling bass you probably need a car.Again, within the limits of physics Bose has done a great job here. I can't complain. Calls and recorded speech are great! Music is good enough for me, at least on the road. I can't take my home system with me when I travel so I know what to expect.Four stars for sound and bass, five overall for excellent ANC (20-25 dB I would guess). Speech and calls (at least on my end) are great! I can interact with clients and reps while exercising, getting coffee or doing just about anything besides operating a chain saw. For that reason I love the headphones! Is it the best music reproduction on the planet? No. But I'll take it while I'm stranded in Denver waiting for my next flight.Good job Bose!","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AEROHBBCRM7TESY3O5YRCC5WLP3A,True,5,Color: Black

RG8UDLRR9FZ1T,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars For me it is perfect, but depends on your use",Amazon Customer,5,"I’ve been a fan of Bose for a long time. I have the 25, 35, Gaming Headset, Aviation Headset and now the model 700. My original 25 broke the arm holding the ear cup and Bose replaced it for free, although it was just out of warranty. I now use the 25 (wired) for my home computer. The 35 my daughter “borrowed” permanently, and my gaming headset is at work. So, I wanted a wireless headset for TV, music, call, etc. at home. The Bose 25, 35, etc. are just very comfortable and perfect for my uses. But the 700 was a completely different style. For that reason, I was more interested in the 45.Price of course was a consideration, and at the time of Prime Days, the price difference was minimal.I’m not an audiophile, so I trusted other online reviews for a comparison of the model 45 to the 700 and Sony. My most trusted site for reviews of electronics is Tom’s Guide, and they had an excellent comparison. I finally chose the 700 over the 45 at the last minute. I made a good choice as I am very pleased with the headset. It is very comfortable, the sound is awesome, the touch controls are nice, and the equalizer was useful for increasing treble as I lost some hearing in that range, (too many concerts).The only negative I have found, which was mentioned in the online reviews, is that the headset clamps your head tighter than the previous models. This is fine for me wearing it for movies at night so my apartment neighbors don’t get upset. However, if you are wearing them for more than a couple hours, the model 45 might be a better choice.One additional note, which may be user or a software issue. I was having a hard time with the Bluetooth connection from my TV (LG) to my 35. I needed to delete the pair and re-pair many times. The model 700 connected every time so far.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AEMYRJTWDIONAF5ZT4RRNHKGDHTA,True,24,Color: Black
R2KHN4AC1NRP0T,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Weak sound and literally the worst return process on Amazon I've experienced,The Overlord,1,"I've been using V-Moda Crossfades for years but wanted to try something out with noise cancelling. These were highly recommended and after my sister got a pair and really liked them, I opted to give them a try. While the functional features seem to be really convenient, the lack of tactile feedback when using the headphones to navigate music is super annoying and it's too easy to accidentally brush/swipe the side of the headphone and fast forward or rewind a song unintentionally. The noise cancelling is a really nice feature and does work great, but the reasons I ultimately wound up sending these back are:1. The actual volume level max is way too quiet compared to my V-Modas and since I have a taste for loud music, this was really disappointing.2. The bass is weak as hell. My V-Moda probably have almost twice the bass production and it was very, very noticeable and messing with the EQ did not help at all (it just marks everything else quieter and honestly the EQ settings were pretty crappy anyways).Pros: VERY comfortable, easy to wear around your neck when you're not listening to them, voice works really well, controls are quick to respond, the app has a great UI, the battery life is great and the USB-c charging is a godsend. Noise cancelling is fantastic.Cons: Volume max is too quiet for anyone with even MILD hearing issues, bass leaves a lot to be desired, controls are too easy to bump and provide no tactile feedback.Conclusion: If you like heavy bass and tend to listen to the upper range of volume levels, I find my V-Modas are still way better. If you don't need it that loud and aren't so concerned about heavy bass, these are great headphones with a few minor nitpicks.Why 1 star overall, you ask? This has come down to the return process. I sent them in weeks ago and was only give ONE return option: Amazon Locker. I usually do UPS and they are immediate to process the refund as soon as my return is scanned by UPS and sent out to the returns center that day. I did 10 returns on the same day as these headphones, all via UPS with the exception of the headphones going to a locker. All were scanned that day. The other items refunded quickly. These, however, have been ""in transit"" for over two weeks now and have yet to refund. The return gives you zero indication on where the item is even physically at, let alone going, and for something I ordered and received within 3 hours of ordering, the fact that it's taking over two weeks for Amazon to receive the item (I live IN Seattle, BTW) is absolutely ridiculous. They were awfully quick to take my money but dragging their feet on this return, and customer service has been completely unhelpful. For whatever reason with locker returns you don't get your return until the return center itself receives the item, so if their courier messes up and loses your item, you're stuck waiting over two weeks before amazon will lift a finger to push your refund through and even then they are running me in circles. Nevermind the fact that it is not my responsibility what happens to this item once it has been scanned and picked up my the courier. If they lose it, I get a refund anyways, but have to wait for this arbitrary 2 week period *because reasons* (literally nobody can explain why it's like this with the lockers but not with ANY OTHER METHOD I've used for returns in the last 10 years). For such a pricey item, this has been an infuriating experience and quite frankly I'm at the point where I will never order something this expensive from amazon again if THIS is the kind of response I get when their courier or returns center has obviously messed something up. When I called again today, the agent told me it has arrived at the returns center and has been sitting waiting to get scanned. They said to wait 3-5 more days. That will make it 3 weeks. And then however long it takes for the banks to do their part. For someone who has been using amazon for a decade and easily spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on this platform (likely far more), this is a less than desirable process and I'm at the end of my patience. This refund should have processed when they scanned the item and NOT fallen on me to carry while their shipper either screws up and loses this item or takes their sweet slow time sending it to a returns center I can only suspect is located on another effing star system / planet. For an item I got in 3 hours.Good headphones, not good for mildly bad hearing, and literally the worst amazon return service I've ever experienced. First world problems, yes, but having had such an extensive hisoltory with amazon and doing god knows how many returns, I have plenty of context for how inexcusable CRAP this process has been in respect to allllllllllllllll the returns I've done in the last decade.Beware.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2022",AEGQTZFMGWX4KQJ3YEC3RF3UO6TA,True,17,Color: Black
RQ579YEPODZRZ,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very good, for now, hoping it gets better",Vanished,4,"So i have tried the Bose QCII and Sony MX3s extensively. I loved the QCs the most purely due to comfort and dual connectivity... however both were terrible at taking calls/voice recognition/ mics etc. These definitely take the throne in that. As others have mentioned theres definite hiccups here but i am a little bit more patient. Bose is not a good software company. At first they did fit real tight as others have suggested but maybe i am getting used to it. I have used it one one flight so far and one thing i did notice was the plane rattles going through to the cup, which was a cause for concern... but as we speak i will use them on a flight again and maybe i didnt have them as snug as hey should be as i was wearing sunglasses. The noise cancelling is apparent but maybe not as insanely impressive as others have suggested- i can hear voices when music isnt playing. It totally mutes hisses, droning, etc.. but i can hear other noises- maybe thats an issue with my headphones? Not sure quite yet. This might be me, but i actually think the music quality got better the more i used them- i dont think these need burn in but i noticed it after a day of usage. They do get warmer than the QCs and they do fall forward n back more than the QCs used to. They certainly dont ""disappear"" like the QCs do but theres certainly trade offs. They QCs have an awful mic and thats a big deal for a lot. These have far superior noise cancelling than the QCs. The sonys are just too heavy for me and they fell off far easier if you lean forward or back. They also definitely do make your ears sweat. The NC 700s have similar touch buttons... i kinda hate them... possibly more so because they didnt just put them on both sides. I also think at this price these should have auto off for when you take them off akin to airpods or other such devices. I will be trying them out for a bit longer. I would go back to considering the QC35s but they've suspiciously gotten worse due to recent firmware.As far as design, they look good wearing them, but they look not so great on their own. I wished they'd have had more color options from the get go. I don't think they should be this expensive considering the features. The button lay out is a little confusing and the band sticking out as it does is not so great as in an airplane you are probably leaning on things and its a little more concerning than the QCs were but the same time these have the cusion on the outside too at some portion.All in all, i hope it gets better and i imagine they will make it happen considering the poor customer reviews so far. They can't afford to make this a failed product so i imagine they're going to crank out updates and newer features. The buttons should be customizable as you desire. The charging is fine. 20 hours vs 30 hours is similar, im charging it every other day anyhow. Hopefully the rattling that comes through isnt an ongoing issue cuz i really need something with a great mic. QCs are better comfort and fit wise but these have the tech you'd want in them. Who knows maybe we see an upgraded QC as well.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2019",AECFHWHKQGKQFL2TW7NC4HKBU7PQ,True,7,Color: Black
R1KLS6L3C6XV2A,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones, questionable interface",Anonymous,4,"These headphones are on par with the prior, and cheaper, Bose Quiet Comfort (QC) and Quite Comfort 2 headphones in terms of audio quality and comfort. The big difference is the interface, which is mostly worse.The instruction manual does not tell you how to control the headphones. You have to look for a YouTube video, which I cannot post a link to here because of a ridiculous Amazon rule against that. So here is a brief description of what controls you have and what they should have been.There is a pushbutton on the right speaker with a Bluetooth label. Press to turn on the headphones and hold to pair. This is fine, but the Bose QC had a better interface, a switch with an off, on, and pair position. The pair position had a springiness that had to be held to initiate pairing. That was a great interface.Below the power/pair button is a button to send a verbal command to the paired device. Without the Bose app, on an Android phone this will prompt you to either perform a Google search or make a call. With the Bose app, you can send the command to a voice assistant like Amazon’s echo. This interface is fine, but it would more sense to have two separate buttons for “ask…” and “call…”.On the left speaker there is a single pushbutton that toggles between three noise cancelling levels: 0 for none, 5 for medium, 10 for maximum. These levels can be customized with the Boss App. A better interface would have been a rocker control. In fact, there should have been two rocker controls: one for noise canceling levels on the left speaker that says the number as it goes through them, and one on the right speaker for volume that just beeps.And now for the bad part. The right speaker also acts as a touch surface for gestures to do a few critical things. To toggle between pausing or playing, double tap the surface. This feels like you are hammering your eardrum and is quite loud. To go back or forward a track swipe forwards or backwards. This is awkward and unreliable. To raise or lower the volume swipe up or down. This is also awkward and unreliable, and also imprecise.A better interface for these controls would have been to use a rocker as described previously for the volume and a three pushbutton array for prior-track, pause/play, next-track. All together, that’s just 4 control areas, two per speaker, that can be found by feel and muscle memory and provide tactile feedback. Such an interface would be far more comfortable, intuitive, and easy to use than the gimmicky touch interface.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2020",AE3LTKGZ7X5FKCV6SBMV7ZCYJEAQ,True,0,Color: Black
R3KKF9VY8LXJOU,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Buggy software and buggy hardware,Inderjit Jutla,3,"A lot of other reviews will tell you about the sound quality/build quality/etc. I generally agree with that, but I ran into a lot of bugs that I didn't see in a lot of reviews:Hardware Bugs:After about 2 months of using these headphones, they would randomly turn off and reboot in the middle of whatever I was doing. Whether it was just listening to music or in the middle of a call. Very frustrating. I contacted Bose about it and they did thankfully offered to replace them at no cost to me. That was nice but it did take 2 weeks of not having my headphones to get the new ones (since I had to ship mine back first).The 'self voice' feature is sometimes good but I noticed it can sometimes mistake outside noise for my voice. One example is when there was a guy water jet cleaning across the street. The sound of it was loudly fed into my headphones (which I assume is a bug in the self voice feature). Pretty disappointing to have your 'noise cancelling' headphones unnecessarily feed outside noise into your ears. I turned this feature off.A minor nitpick I have is that in quiet environments, I notice that the headphones, when set to '0' noise cancelling can actually be noticeably louder than not wearing the headphone at all. I thought this might be due to the 'self voice' feature but I still had the issue when self voice was turned off. I understand this from an engineering perspective but again, 'noise cancelling' headphones should not be LOUDER than with no headphones, regardless of the situation. This issue is mostly fixed if I always keep my headphones noise cancelling at '10'.Software Bugs:The app has a lot little bugs that are kind of annoying. On the galaxy s9, often the app will not see my headphones, even when they are actively playing audio from my phone. Restarting the app typically fixes this.During the initial device setup phase of the app, if my phone tries to automatically pair to these headphones (and I let it), it can sometimes confuse the app and the app will not let me set up the headphones. I have to play around with unpairing my headphones and trying again to make it work.Another annoying issue is that if I have '0' in my list of noise cancelling levels and I have the headphones remember my last noise cancelling level: When I first turn on my headphones, and it's set to '0', my first click of the left button on my headphones does nothing, my second click jumps straight to the 3rd option. E.g. if my noise cancelling levels are set to 0, 5, 10. The noise cancelling will start at 0, I click the button, it does nothing, I click the button again, it goes to '5'. And I have to cycle through 0 again to get to 10.Nitpick: the voice assistant on the headphones cuts the audio to the headphones. E.g. when I mute the headphones, it cuts off my audio for about a second when telling me it's muted. Same when I unmute the headphones. It does not do this if I have voice assistant turned off. (it will instead play a nice tone)Final thoughts:Overall the headphones are still good, you can look to other reviews for all the positive aspects of the sound, noise cancelling, and mic. But these issues tell me Bose did a poor job of testing these headphones. If I only had 1 or 2 of the above issues, I would have given the headphones a 9/10, but with all these issues, I can't give the headphones more than 7/10, especially for $350.

The noise cancellation is almost too good where at times i cant even hear what is going on in the background; thankfully you can adjust the noise cancellation. The wireless range for them work very well just as long as you dont go too many rooms away. I have yet to test out the quality while wired, but will probably get the opportunity to test this out in the coming days.

I can’t find them anywhere now to purchase new. So, after researching a bit, I decided on these Bose headphones.They are an aesthetically pleasing design, over-the-ear, not on the ear. They are much more comfortable to sleep in than my Beats were. I can fall asleep and wake up hours later in the night to pee, not because my ears are sore.Being over-the-ear, they are very comfortable headphones. I traveled a lot with my Beats and wore them for hours on end at a time. Sometimes my ears would get a little sore or hot after hours of use.They do not cancel noise nearly as well as my Beats did. A substantial amount of noise gets through, even on the highest setting. My Beats were like noise deprivation headphones. Very solid noise cancellation.The buttons are placed in super inconvenient locations, so that when you grab your headphones to adjust them, you will definitely hit those buttons.The swipe feature on the headphones is a nice touch, and I like it. You can swipe for volume or track skips.They come in a hard case, which would be kind of nice, except today is December 2nd, and I bought these new and have had them since October 30th, and the zipper on the case has broken already, rendering the case completely useless. The case lasted less than a month.Overall, these headphones aren’t bad. But I might consider returning them and just trying to find something more comparable to my old Beats Solo Pros. Had the case not broken almost immediately, I might be more inclined to keep them, but that was kind of like the last straw.Update 02/14/2024:I sold these and purchased a pair of Beats Solo Pros.

Best case for carrying headphones of any I've ever bought (I've owned 4+ different other brands). Perfect for traveling business person.2. Good fit and I can easily wear all day in comfort. I'd imagine they get hot if outdoors, but that's true of all headphones that are over-ear and have ear-cups that fit to head for better noise cancelation.3. Excellent voice controls...tells you battery life when turn on, and tells you what 2 devices you are connected to. Also has Alexa which I like because I just say ""Alexa, play Sirius XM Turbo"" and it starts playing that Sirius station. Can use any Alexa type question. This is optional so you don't have to use. You can also use Google Voice and Siri if you prefer.4. Excellent looking and nice finger press gestures on headphone sides to control things like volume, or double tap to answer call, etc. Keeps the buttons to very minimum which is great for looks and less things to break.5. Love that I can connect to both iPhone and Laptop for zoom/teams calls at same time. I often do a zoom call, then end it, start playing music from phone, then answer call...all with headphones.6. Music sounds much better on these than my Apple airpods (both old ones and new Pro ones). Much better bass for sure.Cons1. You do need the mobile app to easily setup. It will automatically download updates and install, but it doesn't notify you it's doing in background, so when you initially try to connect to Windows 10 it doesn't work because there are patches in firmware that allow it to work. Took about 30 minutes for new firmware to install in background and then worked fine.2. Sometimes Windows 10 won't find your Bose headphones when connecting via bluetooth the first time. Make sure to turn bluetooth on/off multiple times on windows 10 until it shows up. It eventually does. I think this is a Windows 10 problem because it showed up fine when connecting to iPhone.Hopefully they work/stay working for at least 2+ years...all my other headphones have broken after just 1 year, mainly because I travel a ton between customer sights, offices, and planes. I'm hoping the really good case the Bose headphones have keeps everything working well for multiple years.

RLMQBUKEYVW5K,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is Good, Build Questionable",Trent,3,"For starters, I’m not really going to review the sound quality, because in short they sound like a $300 pair of headphones. You can tweak the settings and make a custom EQ in the Bose Music app, so you can make it what you will. I listen to a lot of jazz, instrumental, metal, and I’m satisfied.My main issues are with this current generation of ANC and the build quality on the Bose 700’s.ANC: On one hand, it’s good. In certain environments I feel like I’m in a bubble and I can’t hear the world beyond. It’s perfect, just my music. In others, I can hear more than I would like. We’re talking, literally, I can listen to classical symphonic music on a lawn mower at a decent volume and hear the dynamics. It’s fantastic. There, I’m truly impressed. However at work, I sit at a desk and there’s machinery some 300 feet away. Drill press, a saw, and chiefly a large fan that’s always on for ventilation. It is loud, yes, but I also get the sense even on the highest setting, ANC isn’t fully engaged. I think this because I’ve ever had the 700’s on and sneezed, dropped something, or otherwise had a sudden loud noise nearby and I can feel what’s like a diaphragm move. Pressure changes in the cup, and momentarily that super loud sound is muted greater than the atmospheric noises. E.G. an alarm goes off at work and each individual tone going off results in a higher noise cancellation sensation. When I have ANC maxed out, I want it truly maxed out, not on an algorithm. You can already adjust what level you want ANC on, so I see no benefit to this feature. If I want to be deaf to the world, considering the original MSRP, I better be. If anything else it’s very jarring to hear the accompanying “popping” that occurs with the added acute noise cancellation.Build quality: See picture…I’ve had these three months, have only worn them daily for two weeks as a test and the stainless steel frame has scratches from the ear cups. Also, every time I turn my head, a wonderful rubbing sound of the ear cup turning. In this department I am a bit of a snob. I typically don’t buy headphones that make a lot of frictional noise. As in I’ll literally jiggle display pairs of headphones to see if I can hear the plastic on plastic rubbing sound cheap pairs are plagued by. Anytime I’ve worn them outside I’ve wiped them off with a microfiber cloth and exclusively store them in the case. Aside from the vibrations from the aforementioned lawnmower, I have babied these due to the price. Hearing a plasticky popping sound whenever I turn my head, chew, adjust my glasses, is not something I expected from headphones marketed as having a stainless frame. This alone makes me wish I would have bought the Sony MK4’s.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022",AHNFTZAN2B3J2EL5L63LKPHKSEJQ,True,3,Color: Black
R127X8IU9C9MGJ,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Noise Cancellation, a Must-Have for Travelers",C,5,"I have experienced several noise-canceling headphones over the years, but these Bose headphones have set a new standard for me. Their exceptional noise-canceling capability, especially noticeable during air travel, is simply outstanding.What truly impresses me is the difference in ambient noise levels when I wear these headphones. For example, it’s only when I remove them, to go to the restroom on a plane, that I realize just how loud a plane can be. It’s a serious game changer.Comfort is another aspect where these headphones excel. Long flights can be tiring, but with these headphones, comfort is never compromised. Plus, the inclusion of an audio jack alongside Bluetooth connectivity is a thoughtful touch. It allows me to easily switch from my Bluetooth devices (phone) to the airplane’s entertainment system, ensuring I can enjoy movies without any hassle.Durability is another strong suit. After several years of use, they still perform like new. This quality so impressed my partner that we ended up purchasing a second pair. This speaks volumes about the product’s reliability and value. No pun intended.In summary, if you’re looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that offer superior sound isolation, comfort, and versatility, then look no further. These Bose headphones are well worth the investment for any frequent traveler or anyone seeking a haven of quiet in a noisy world.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2023",AEZN7IXLUZ6E7PGB2KRIUWDKMTEQ,True,2,Color: Black

Noise cancellation is better than any other headphones Ive had other than the previous BOSE. I fall asleep on airplanes when wearing them, it is that good, dead silence in a noisy plane. Only complaint is that the earmuffs fold outward which when wearing gives the slight sensation like they aren't pushed against you in the front. The old bose I had folded inward so Im used to feeling like they are sucked into my ears and firmly there. But since these fold up by the ear piece rolling outward towards the front it feels like its not hugging against my face there if that makes sense.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2024",AFZAQAESKZNYVKKBQEGOYPE6MWQQ,True,0,Color: Black

R32CKBN0I3XEPG,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Update,"H, Phillips",5,"I hope my review did not dissuade anyone from trying these phones. I did successfully connect them via wire to my MP3 player and the difference was startling. The music was bright and the sound stage was full range. However, used with the wired connection, the Bluetooth slide, touch and tap functions did not work.What I realize now is that I didn’t give these Bose phones a long enough trial period. After listening via cable, I went back to try again with the Bluetooth. I must have had something hooked up wrong because this time after listening for several hours to a variety of music my experience has done a complete 180. I will definitely keep these phones. ********Yes or No? This noise-suppressing headset replaces my previous wired Bose that I either misplaced or someone in the gym walked off with—I suspect the latter.This Bose is quite different from my earlier BOSE headset. For starters, this one is Bluetooth and it creates a problem I hadn’t anticipated. The BT interferes with my hearing aids. My original QC35 had bright, full smooth sound with or without my hearing aids.By contrast, the sound of my new 700 is not a bright sound; though the stereo spread is good, the overall sound is muffled and the bass does not seem as realistic. Is that related to the Bluetooth function? The 700 can be used as a wired connection; but so far, I can’t get that connection to work.My previous QC headset did not have its own volume control; I had to adjust volume and other functions from my MP3 player; the new 700 phones do have their own volume control plus slide, touch or tap functions; though convenient, there is a learning curve to avoid pause, next or previous song and a bit of frustration when I can’t quite position my finger in the right place. Finding the right place quickly is often unsafe when I need to remove my hand from a bicycle or elliptical machine.The 700 has other functions as well that work in combination with Bluetooth cell phones; but I can’t speak on behalf of those controls as yet. I have Google Assistant, but not Alexa.My primary purpose in buying over-the-ear headphones is noise suppression, specifically for use in the gym. Though the QC’s were excellent— especially to cancel out the constant drone of an airplane engine; the 700 is spectacular in various locations and can be tuned to different levels of noise suppression.Return? Or Not? That’s going to be a tough decision. But I really do prefer a brighter sound with body-shaking, yet realistic bass.","Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2020",AHGKWGJ5MBNJF27TPDBRCWAMN5JQ,True,1,Color: Silver Luxe
R33JSTM2HLZ0OY,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Versatile headphone, Good Sound, Exceptional Noise Cancellation",Sandip Gautam,4,"I purchased this headphone, about 8 months before. I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll make it short. Here's my opinion- Excellent sound quality, and noise cancellation. I use this headphones all the time, at work (meetings), in home(movies), while traveling(music). Just everywhere.- Battery life is around 15-20 hrs, which is descent. Could have been a bit longer.- Charging is quick.- I have 3 device profile saved in headphones. But, at any given time only 2 device can be connected. For eg., say my phone and my laptop. But, sound can be played from only 1 device at a time. Meaning, I need to pause audio in one device, in order to play audio on other device, but do not have to go through hassle of disconnecting one device, and connecting other.- A 2.5 to 3.5 connector is included with the product, but it's length is very short. You might need to get a longer cable. Meaning, you can play audio even if your battery is dead, but sound quality falls drastically.- Once in a while, I will have issues pairing my devices. Not too often. But, I can live with it.- I usually prefer to wear my headphones for an extended period of time, i.e., 4-6 hours, or more even. These headphones feel comfortable initially for around 2-2.5 hr, but after that heads start hurting because these headphones do have very strong clamping force (which explains the exceptional noise cancelling).- Would I prefer Sony WH series over these? If I need more battery life, and more comfortable wearing for extended time, YES. For sound quality, and noise cancellation (NO).","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2023",AFBLW453P2J7MCXHYZ4SSV6QNKHQ,True,9,Color: Black
R2ZKFPSTFPA42V,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Good all around headphones,John Q Public,5,"To start with, the noise cancellation is superb. Whether I was in a noisy coffee shop or on a bustling city street or a noisy gym, the headphones effectively blocked out the external sounds, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or audiobook.One of the standout features for me was how easy it was to connect and switch between devices. With just a few taps on my phone, I could seamlessly switch from my laptop to my tablet without any hassle. It made my multitasking life much more convenient.As for the sound quality, I found it to be more than satisfactory. While I'm not an audiophile myself and primarily listen to classical or soft soundtracks, the headphones delivered clear and balanced audio. The melodies and instruments were rendered beautifully, capturing the nuances of the music.I came across some reviews mentioning that the accompanying app required location access, but I found this to be untrue in my experience. I was able to connect and play my music without being prompted to share my location. This was a relief for me, as privacy is important, and I appreciate that the headphones respected that.In conclusion, these headphones offer outstanding noise cancellation, easy device connectivity, and enjoyable sound quality. I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking a reliable and user-friendly audio solution.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AF4WLVA63GNQO4S6S3L2CYDDA6CQ,True,10,Color: Black

Got these for loud upstairs neighbors and they have been great. (Haven’t been on a plane with them) I have a narrow face/head and they are good for long stretches of wearing without any pressure. Comfy fit!Cons: That is also the problem, they don’t squeeze my head so they are not stable if I lean forward to pick up items off the floor. With a baseball hat it’s much better. They ear pads spin in order to lay flat for travel and since they are on a round headset, they spin the Moment you try to move them off. (Had Beats and they are super stable for moving off of one ear)Also the buttons are super sensitive, as well as the touch controls, and I have accidentally hit buttons or skipped a song just taking them off.Overall: Excellent purchase and love the noise cancelling with sound quality.

R2A7ROA8UQKRVG,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great ANC, Bad Battery Life, Limited Performing Voice Calling",Donny,3,"I've owned the Bose QC35 ii for three years now and I can say they are the BEST ANC headphones and have the BEST USER EXPERIENCE, not so good on voice pick up during calls in noisy environments. I'm in the consumer device tech industry and travel for business often, and have been looking in the market for headphones that have good ANC and also have good voice pick up for calls. I was ecstatic when Bose came out with the NC700, having both ANC + voice pick up. As expected, they have great ANC and great listening quality, just as good, if not better, as the QC35s. Beyond that, my experience starts to drop. I did my first conference call with the NC700 in the car on the freeway going to airport, and the voice pick up FAILED. The experience started out great, my colleagues would hear me clearly with no issue, with reduce noise background and clear voice quality. It seemed the NC700 was doing well with the voice pick up. Then all of sudden, intermittently, my voice volume would reduce during the call to the point my colleagues could not hear me or any of the background noise. I can see my input voice volume level monitor from my app and it would notice it reduce to zero. Then after 20-30 seconds later, my voice would pick back up again and my colleagues can hear me loud and clear. This happened a few times during the conference call to the point that I just stopped using the head-set and started using my phone's microphone. Very embarrassing when your coworkers are saying, ""we can't hear you!"" and you've been talking for the last few minutes. Since then, I've tested the NC700's voice pick up quality in different environments, with different apps, PC vs Phone, and results are mixed but more on the failing side. The voice pick up failure happens on any device, with any app. Sometimes it works, most cases it doesn't. Sometimes I can go through a 30 minutes conference call at the airport with no voice pick up issues. Then most times in descent noisy areas, it would just fail within minutes, and I would have to revert to my phone. In a quite room or area, works great! In addition to the voice pick up fail, the battery life sucks! After a full charge, it would say 18 hours of usage available. Within 2-3 hours of continuous use, it would say 10 hours of usage available. What happened to the 8 hours? Just recently, on a full charge, the headset lasted only 10 hours. My journey was business trip, 2 hours on the road, 6 hours on a plane, 2 hours waiting in lobbies, from leaving my place to getting to my destination. Fully charged when I left, dead on arrival at my destination. Oh yeah, almost forgot, the Bose App also sucks. I always have to reconnect my headset to the app in order for the app to recognize my headset. Also I have to keep logging back in, with user name and password, after I wake up the app. It doesn't like to keep my info or keep my logged in. In addition to the app experience, I always get this RED warning notification my headset isn't connected to WIFI. I'm not sure why I need Wifi to have this operate normally. Very annoying. I do have a wireless unlimited data plan. My wife has the same pair, but her voice pick up seems better. She uses to call me while she's on the bus and she's loud a clear the whole conversation. As for me, it cuts out. I'm returning NC700 and getting a replacement.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2019",AGJYFL2XXXPX2WTCZS4HPIKLRYLA,True,18,Color: Black

R22T3INHVMO8JR,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but with problems...",Nigel Palmer,3,"Ever since the Bose QC 35 II headphones were released, I have been keeping an eye on the heavy hitters in the over-ear, noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones space. A year after the Bose 700 headphones were released, I finally purchased a pair, but was overall disappointed after using them for nearly a month (see below) and replaced them with the newer Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones.On to my experience with the Bose 700 headphones...PROS:- Look great/professional/sleek.- Noise cancellation performance is very good... I also like the shortcut buttons that allow you to change the levels.- Great voice pickup/clarity.- Clear overall audio/music sound quality, but with caveats (see below).- I like the smooth sliding mechanism for sizing.- Pretty comfortable and they don't get overly warm in the ear muffs... slightly more top pressure than I would like, but most folks probably won't have a problem.CONS:- Unstable firmware... as of this writing (Aug/Sep 2020), Bose prevented earlier firmwares (e.g. v1.31) from upgrading to the newer firmware version(s) with the sound equalizer feature due to widespread reports of battery issues and other problems. I thought my headphones were defective until I dug around various internet forums to finally find out what was going on. Firmware problems after over a year since release is not a good sign, and I expect that Bose will release a newer product to compete with Sony at this point before they ever fully fix the 700s.- Bluetooth issues... mine would occasionally cause audio distortion when paired with two devices at once (e.g. a PC and smartphone).- Power issues... mine would randomly shut off 1-2x per day, often in the middle of important conference calls.- Battery issues... I was getting at most around 14 hours of battery life despite mine being brand new. Granted your audio and noise cancellation settings can affect this, but still disappointing compared to the manufacturer-advertised 20 hours of battery life.- Sound quality, though overall very clear, is fairly low on bass and volume. I had to crank the volume up much higher compared to the newer Sony headphones to reach satisfying levels. I can't comment on the new equalizer feature to help the bass due to the firmware issues mentioned above.- Pressure... with noise cancellation on, my ears often felt like they were in a pressurized container which felt a little odd and uncomfortable. I don't notice this happening with other over-ear noise cancellation headphones.- Bulky... these don't fold at all so the case is a little big considering that many users will want these for travel.- The 2.5mm headphone port for occasional wired use is a little inconvenient (even considering the included cable) compared to Sony's 3.5mm port where I can use other cables that I already have.- No airline wired adapter included... not a deal-breaker these days, but other manufacturers still include one.- The MSRP is a little high considering heavy competition from less expensive/arguably better/newer headphones like the Sony WH-1000MX4s. However, I will note that these can be found on sale for a quite a bit lower than the MSRP and often cheaper than the newest Sony model.The verdict... these cost too much to have to deal with firmware problems/delays, Bluetooth issues, and poor battery life. Maybe mine were defective after all. In any case, I returned these and bought the newer Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones instead, and so far they do not have the problems that I discussed here.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AFBPJIJSGK63NDJOLKOZ2A4OGVBQ,True,12,Color: Black

R3A8NPRL67P0IW,B07Q9MJKBV,"1.0 out of 5 stars Yes the audio quality is good, but IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!",Marcey,1,"The media could not be loaded. I LOVE headphones. I’m an audio quality snob, and before these headphones, audio quality has always taken precedence over any and every part of the headphones. NO MORE. I WAS WRONG. I've had them just under a year, and (UNFORTUNATELY) have used them almost every single day of that. The audio quality on these things is great (really just if you use the aux cord, bluetooth is nothing amazing), but believe me when I say IT’S NOT WORTH IT. There are other headphones out there with quality just as amazing. Let me tell you why you don’t want them.1. They turn themselves back on. Not at a random time, not for any particular reason I can find... maybe 4 out of ten times when I turn them off, they immediately turn themselves back on. And the auto-off setting they have DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY. It’s very inconsistent, so there’s no guarantee your headphones aren’t on all night.2. They eat hair. Not just sometimes- MOST of the time. I wear them every single day, and I lose hair to them every single day.3. They WILL slip and fall off of your head. No, you don’t have to be doing anything extreme. Bend over, there go your headphones. And if you care about your skin, like me, trust me when I say that the band across the top that sits on your hair all the time WILL find its way onto your forehead far too often.4. The mic is garbage unless you have the aux plugged in. If you’re using bluetooth, it will sound like you’re in a cave in space, 20 feet away from the microphone. There hasn’t been a single time I answered a call with these headphones (with no aux) and the person asked where the **** I am because the sound and quality are so ridiculous.5. They will not turn off if they’re not connected to anything. Once or twice I’ve made the mistake of thinking, well turning them off doesn’t work, maybe if they can’t connect to anything then they’ll shut off after a while. NOPE, they just stay on until they die. As I mentioned, there’s a setting you can change to make them turn off after a period of inactivity. Apparently that doesn’t count as inactivity. Know what does?6. Turning on the hear-through function. That counts as inactivity. I have my headphones set to turn off after five minutes of inactivity. (This is hit or miss to start with.) For the hear-through function, if your headphones are on, connected to something, actively playing something, or playing something but you paused it, and you hit the hear-through function, you’ll be able to hear through the headphones like they’re not there... until the auto-off function kicks in, because apparently walking around on your head with a specific function turned on isn’t enough activity. They will turn off. If you had something playing, then the experience will go like this- you’re focused on whatever it is that you turned hear-through on for, when suddenly the hear-through stops, the noise-cancelling turns on, whatever you had playing before turns back on for just a few seconds, then the headphones play their turning-off tone and turn off. Why? Is this a bug? No one could have purposefully decided to make them do this, right?7. They beep before every audio message!! Actually, it’s not even before, it’s at the start of every audio message. The beep PLAYS OVER THE BEGINNING of every audio message. Got a message that’s 5 seconds long? Too bad! Better disconnect your headphones!8. Ohhh so you had to turn your bluetooth off because they kept turning back on for no reason? Well, when you turn your bluetooth back on, they won’t connect automatically, you’ll have to go into your settings to connect to the demon headphones again.9. Using the aux cord disables the touch controls. You'll have to take your phone out the skip forward or backwards.10. If you lose the aux, rest assured you don't have a spare laying around. It's a 2.5mm - 3.5mm aux. One side, the one that goes into the headphones, is much smaller than normal.These things.... do not buy these things.

If the battery starts to go on me, then I have been at the computer too long!There is a button that can adjust the amount of sound cancelation from 10 which blocks virtually all constant noise, 5 which i suspect is just the headphones physically blocking sound, to 0 where the headphones transmit ambient sounds to my ears. It ever so slightly enhances my hearing. Like, set to 0, I can faintly hear the rain outside/on the roof, but if I remove them, I can't hear it anymore.There are two modes on the headphones, ""headphones"" and ""headset."" Headphones is just for listening and is better sound quality, headset uses a speaker so you can talk to people.

They've *both* started to malfunction in a dramatic way: Sudden, painful screeching feedback while using, akin to what happens when you hold a microphone up to the speaker. For this problem to appear with both headsets, in a similar timeframe, suggests that something is seriously wrong here. Maybe it was a software update? Warning folks: These are now officially a Beta release, and this is coming from a HUGE Bose fan.UPDATE: So my second pair of NC700's came and it functioned flawlessly. I like it so much I bought a second pair in silver. However, I have a new beef with Bose, and new users should be warned:YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP WITH A BOSE ACCOUNT JUST TO USE THE FEATURES ON THIS HEADSET, AND THE APP ROUTINELY MALFUNCTIONS IN WAYS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM USING ALL FEATURES. GOD HELP YOU IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS AND YOU CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET TO LOG IN.(1) Dear Bose, maybe some McKinsey or BCG consultants (or worse, your own internal strategy team) told you that you need to be a content company. Thus, you must 'own' your users, so they are captive in your ecosystem. I think you should focus on hardware, but TO REQUIRE users to have an account with you just to use a pair of headphones? That is unacceptable, and in really bad faith. I know the response (I work in this world): We need to store user information to enhance the user experience, by enabling us to store logins with streaming services and digital assistants. It's a security issue. Agreed, BUT nothing about that should stop you from letting us OPT OUT and just use the headphone in 'headphone mode', and still be able to change our settings, deactivate voice prompts, etc., without logging in. Nothing about that functionality requires an account with Bose, or a login. We both know that, Bose and I, because the app for the QC35ii's did not require it.(2) To add injury to insult (yes, that's what I mean), the app does not work.(a) It routinely logs me out so I have to type my login and password (if I can remember it, I have so many) on my tiny little phone keyboard so I can stop the automatic shut-down tones from waking me up in the middle of my flight to Heathrow - wait, I CAN'T log in, because I have no internet connection. I'm 36,000 feet up over Newfoundland. So much for using my $400 headphones to get a good nights sleep on my way to London. You know a lot of your users use these things on planes, right?(b) Even when I can login, it routinely fails to find the headphones, despite the fact that my iPhone X itself can quickly connect, disconnect, and reconnect to them via Bluetooth.C'mon Bose, don't abuse your loyal fans with this kind of thing. Give us an app that can handle all functionality that doesn't require partner logins (Spotify, Alexa) without logging in. Options like: ""Log in to access personalized services"" or ""Just use my $400 headphones, please"".-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am a huge Bose fan - I own 4 pairs of QC35ii's. I received this pair one week from the release date, and they are defective out of the box. Erratic low frequency pulsing from right ear, not fixed by reboot or other technical support remedy. I've already ordered my next pair, but seriously, Bose? It's a $400 pair of headphones. There is no excuse for poor quality in a new release.

Naturally I thought to upgrade to the newest set of Bose ANC headphones.I purchased and immediately I had all kinds of issues in setup with connecting them to my phone. I was surprised that you have to download an application, etc but that was ok and all but the app had all kinds of issues connecting to the headphones.My first two days with my headphones, I spent about 6 hrs+ on forums, etc. trying to go through various resets, steps to get them up and running. It was very frustrating. I have to say that after that first two days and all those steps I no longer had connection issues so something I finally did must have worked. But to me, paying this kind of money and having to ‘work’ that hard to connect them is really unacceptable.I also felt that coming out of the box and putting them on, the headphones were VERY snug/tight on my head and ears.I understand that you need a snug fit to get great noise cancellation but these were extremely snug on my head. I tried to adjust them up/down, etc. and still felt they were just WAY too tight.I thought maybe there was a ‘break-in’ period so I gave it a few weeks and they just never lost that extremely tight/snug fit and that ‘pressure’ on my ears and scalp.It was just too painful for me and was causing me to get migraines. I admit that I am prone to migraines and I’m overly sensitive to any type of pressure on my head/temples, etc. so this was a no go for me. I want to note that I don’t have this issue with my QC headphones though. They fit snug but not overly so.I also noted that the ear cups/pads were thinner? And this did not help alleviate that pressure. I could feel the ear cup (plastic part of the cup) pushing against my ear instead of the nice soft foam.I think many others may not have these issues and all these issues are just a ‘fit’ issue for me but these just did not fit / work for me and I was really disappointed because I love my Bose QC so much!I might perhaps just try to upgrade to the QC 2 headphones as I’ve heard they are almost identical to the original.I want to say a big thank you to the returns for making it so easy to return my order. It was super easy and quick. No questions asked and I really appreciate that! Thank you.I am giving 3 stars overall because honestly, Bose are awesome and I think this was just a personal ‘fit/comfort’ issue and they were great with my return.

R33YZOC4IHRZTT,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great - prefer QC35 for mute functionality,Travis Cornwell,3,"Loved the QC 35's and was looking for an upgrade that could function for work at home purposes + a casual gamer (5-10 hours per week). Several flaws made me want to return:- Biggest flaw - mute button does not work as advertised with PCs. Great for phone, horrible for PC. There is an alternative available - NC 700's with the Bose Link. On Amazon, you need a business account for that - and even then - reviews of that are mixed for effectiveness of mute function.- No option to switch to a wired microphone. QC35 has the Gaming edition and there are plenty of third party accessories for regular QC35 to convert it to a wired setup. Why a wired microphone? Mute button that works flawlessly with any PC connection. For meetings where I'm speaking frequently, go wired so can mute/unmute easily. For meetings where I'm muted most of the time - go with the wireless headset. QC35 with a wired connection disables bluetooth, but has full noise cancellation in effect - solid win here.- Comfort level isn't quite the same as QC35. As several have described there's more of a clamping force at play vs. a soft cushiony approach.- Can only connect two devices at once. Same as the QC35's - but given the upgrade I would have expected more out of the software. i.e. Let me prioritize which devices I want connected. i.e. Leave my phone connected at all times, but if my work laptop is on, choose it over my personal desktop.- Bass isn't as good as QC 35's. Playing Prodigy's Smack my ___ Up at the 50 second mark when the bass kicks in, there's a clear winner.- Putting in the case you have to collapse the extendible part of the earphones. Then when you pull back out, you have to readjust to the appropriate length. A slightly larger case would have solved this easily. With the QC35s, you leave it extended and fold the headphones, comes out correct length every time.- Can't charge while in the case - I have Jabra Elites for exercise purposes at a much lower price point which can do this. Technology is there, just not implemented.- (Personal preference) - I prefer the tactile feedback of the QC35's when I press the buttons vs the NC700's tapping/sliding/etc.Now for the positive's above the QC35- Much better bluetooth connectivity. Never had a disconnect. With the QC35's, I've had to flip off then back on once or twice during a workday because they randomly lose connectivity.- Noise cancellation. QC35's are good but even at the ""High"" level I can hear outside noises seeping through. NC700's at highest levels block just about everything.- Better battery life.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2021",AEJUO2XJYKKCCFDWRRXSELDOXT2Q,True,0,Color: Black

R3K4O8K9K4UBV5,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best work from home, video conference headphones currently on the market",andrew wright,5,"TLDR - buy these for work from home. The noise cancelling mic is amazing, as is the noise cancelling in the headphones.I don't often write reviews but I feel compelled to help others make an easy decision that I agonized over for too long. Like many, I'm working from home and on Teams/Zoom calls all day. My kids are also home for summer. To cap it off, we're having some construction work done in the space I work. I've had some other less expensive noise canceling headphones for a while and they clearly weren't keeping up.The Bose set was undeniably going to be the best noise cancelling set to listen to. My big question was mic quality and background noise suppression. If you're reading this, you've probably read a million reviews over the last couple years about the mic being the major failing of all these sets for work from home folks.I've had these for a month now and my coworkers couldn't hear a belt sander going all day 15ft from me for days. The mic is amazing at cancelling noise. Of course, the noise cancellation in the headphones is stellar as well.As others have said, these are not the best on earth for full range, deep, powerful base reproduction when listening to music - I'm sure thats due to how low profile the cups are leaving less room for drivers. What you get in return is a headset thats much lighter than they look and are very comfortable to wear for 10hrs a day.The noise cancelling does chew through batteries. They're good for about two days per charge but I charge mine at the end of every day out of habit now.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFOAWGVRPJVGSUJ22JAITMY5ZLCA,True,4,Color: Black
R27T7OEGC1ZK42,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough,Erin McCole Cupp,4,"I needed over-the-ear headphones due to some ear and hearing issues, and I needed them to include the best possible mic I could afford. I did not want noise cancelling because my hearing is troublesome at best, and I actually wanted to be able to maintain contact with the outside world. Bear these things in mind when reading the rest.The mic is adequate. I honestly expected better, given the price, but it's better than what I had before, so... good enough. Same with the sound quality being ""good enough"" but not what I expected, given the price (though I write that with the caveat above that my hearing is not the best to begin with, so take this with whatever grain of salt suits your needs best).As for comfort, they are light and not too pinchy on the ears, but they are ***warm***, and I say this as your typical middle-aged woman who is always cold and is writing this review in the winter.Pairing to my phone is quick and seamless. Pairing to my laptop is hit-or-miss: again, I expected better performance for the cost.I don't know if I'd buy these again, but I'm hoping I won't have to buy anything to replace them any time soon, because this is the most expensive thing I've ever put on my ears. Here's hoping they last.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2023",AHQIYIPMM4EHPVEY5CXNFJWQGKSQ,True,10,Color: Silver Luxe
RFQ0HD4PHE9I8,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars WORTHWHILE UPGRADE IF YOU’RE COMING FROM THE QC35’s (Maybe not the QC35 II’s?),Chris_Dobz,4,"So I have to disagree with the other reviewer that mentioned something about a mandatory app in order to use the headphones since I was immediately able to pair them with my Fire TV Stick 4K and use all the basic functions sans ‘voice assistant’ button. Everything else worked as it should including volume and the left ear button went from full NC to half to off and the long press went to “listen mode” and paused my show I happened to be watching. However, it’s true that you need the app to update firmware and assign the voice assistant (Siri was the default but most likely cause I have an iPhone XS Max).Anyway, I will say that I’ve had/used them for one day so far so my review is more of an “initial impression” and I’ll update it down the road with more use. That said my initial impressions are they are a worthwhile investment if you own the original QC35’s in that they offer a lot more in the way of creature features.Pros:- Active NC is impressive!- Voice Assistant is AWESOME (I’m using Google Assistant but it works great so far).- The have a “conversation button” (not the technical term) on the left ear is worth it’s weight in gold.- Although not rated for any moisture protection the headband material seems like it’ll hold up better in a gym type situation.- FINALLY AMAZING CALL QUALITY!!!!- Sound Quality is on par with the QC35’s so I’m suppose that’s a “pro” in my book.Cons:- Initially not a fan of the “clamp” style but I seemed to get used to it as the day went on but I have a smaller head.- Price!- Didn’t come with a USB adapter....Really Bose?Unknowns:- Battery Life- Bose AR...?- Not sure how I feel about the capacitive touch pad for volume control yet.Final Thoughts:If own the original QC35’s and have always wished you could use them to make calls without everyone on the line being able to hear your in a coffee shop and have always desired the QC35 II’s voice assistant feature then I would at this point recommend pulling the trigger on these bad boys!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2019",AHUTIJS6E4SA3G7HZP5OG2H67CUQ,True,4,Color: Black
R336ZWNSXOHHAX,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive... purchased for noise cancelation feature.,Virty,4,"I'm happy with this purchase. Are they perfect? No. I'm no audio snob and I certainly don't know much about the terminology or specs. I mainly bought these to listen to podcasts, *gasps*, yep. Specifically I was on the hunt for headphones that had enough noise cancelation and good ear cups so that I could listen to my favorite hosts talk (without background audio, just talk) without hearing my boyfriend's words while he talks with friends a few feet away. I took the plunge and made the investment after many reccomendations and reading reviews. After testing them out I'm fairly happy to report that these will work for me. I can hear my bf's voice but not his words, so I am able to focus on the podcasts!Headphones are comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The battery life could be better especially for the price. Wish they included a longer charging cable and actual charger in the base package. Charging time seems to be less than 2 hours. The touch controls are fine. The auto off function is handy. Bose app is kinda neat. The microphone function is very nice and I can answer calls easily.Oh... and music is a delight with these.I can't speak for durability or longevity yet.Hope this helps someone out there make their decision one way or the other.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2023",AGLQY2NKMR64MRL6F5QUOKZAD67Q,True,11,Color: Black

Size was an important to me which meant I ended up with something otherwise fancier than I need.Noise cancellation is excellent, I have sometimes worn them just to reduce background noise. They are comfortable despite my big ears (which are problematic for many headsets.) Comfortable enough that once I forgot I had them on. I have never subjected them to weather since the specs don't indicate that's safe.

I got this for work, I spend many hours on conference calls, talking and listening. I even started doing some youtube for work now. The sound is perfect, hardly worth mentioning, this is Bose, you get perfect noise cancelling with Bose, this is no exception. What matters is the MIC quality, now this one does not have an external MIC, which concerned me a little, but it has the MIC built into the headset, the sound quality is perfect, people who hear me can't quite believe it. The echo/noise cancelling is first rate, the MIC does not pick up people sitting right next to me talking to me. Finally the battery life is long, I just use it for a few days at a time, before charging, its quick to charge, only thing I dont like is that it will just turn off when the battery is spent, it does warn you at 10%, but then just off.

R34426OOIPP9WK,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones -- terrible integration,Chris M.,3,"I'd like to start off with... I am not an audiophile and did not purchase these headphones for music playback in super High Def. I did buy these based off of the YouTuber Mark Rober's recommendation because of the promised noise cancellation quality of both the microphone and speakers. That is 100% on point. I attend video meetings all day long while my kids are being loud, the vacuum is running, my overhead ceiling fan is on, and other household noises. These things are kings of the crop. And, I will say that even though I'm not an audiophile, these headphones sound amazing. Bose is again showing it's leadership in the world of affordable high quality sound engineering.I love the pass through from the mic to my ears so that I can but do not have to let the household noises in. e.g. If my kid wants to talk, but I'm in a meeting. I can turn on the conversation mode, mute my audio, and tell him that he still can't have a cookie for breakfast. Awesome.Cons: Bose is not a software company, and it shows in these headphones. Integration with Alexa is spotty at best as you need to have your iPhone Alexa app open in the background most of the time, but sometimes it works without that need, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Do not rely on this feature, but it's a nice bonus when it does work.Conversation mode is not what I would call consistent. If I'm steaming from my phone with Apple Music or Pandora, then it works fine. If I am streaming any other content, the integration is inconsistent to the point where I can't rely on it. I find myself bringing my phone out, pausing the content, opening the Bose app, reducing noise cancellation to 0, and telling my wife ""Yes, chicken is ok for dinner the fourth night in a row, but by Friday I'm gonna need a steak"".The answering of phone calls or using the touch sensor is inconsistent. (Do you see a pattern here?). Sometimes I can answer a call, sometimes I can't. Really it seems that non music content is my major issue here. Periodically I have to answer the call on my phone, then tell the caller to hold off while I switch to a headset.Touch sensor works great for volume control, but again support for any playback ""buttonless"" functionality other than Music based apps only is clunky.Over all. Great headphones, but don't purchase for the ""super cool"" button-less interface.

R1H6ZIUIF50FJK,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Update: Good noise cancelling.,Alice,4,"I use these headphones for the following: listening to music, tuning out a noisy environment, attending a live-online class. I have had these for almost two months and I LOVE them. I am a musician and thus, somewhat of an audiophile who appreciates refined, balanced sound. I do not care for a bass emphasis in my sound like some brands advertise. These headphones deliver high quality, balanced sound for my middle-aged ears, offer great connectivity and batteries hold their charge (20 hours). Connectivity is streamlined and quick with all my devices. I do not need to be connected to wi-fi for them to function; initially connecting via the Bose app was easy I was able to set them up quickly and Bose customer service was very quick to respond to a question I had during set-up. While I no longer use the Bose app, it was good to get them registered directly with Bose. The noise cancelling option offers 2 different levels (5 and 10)... 10 is amazing cancelling the majority of low-level, bass sounds in the environment. Sometimes I put on my favorite light music or nature sounds, close my eyes and give myself a break from everything. It's like being able to take a mini-vacation from the noise of everyday life. They are also very light-weight and don't squeeze my head like some headphones.Now only time will attest to their reliability/durability.(I look for long-lasting quality in technology, in this world where too much waste is produced).I bought these because I trust in Bose's history of quality and reliability. (Gratefully, I still have my Bose room CD-radio player which I bought 16 years ago). I will write another update in approximately a year. Hopefully, I can report that battery life is still going strong along with everything else.UPDATE 3/2020: They lose blue-tooth connectivity at 3 hours remaining battery-life. I'm pretty disappointed. I bought these for 399.00 and now they sell for 349.00. The ""new"" ones sell for 459.00 and come with a charging case, which is not available for separate purchase.UPDATE 7/2022: With firm updates, blue-tooth connectivity improved.

They just couldn’t handle a bucket of sweat and my friends referred me to the Bose 700.

R1SD4ROL9AU71M,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose doesn't Disappoint,Aaron B.,5,"I love these headphones, I use them every single day and they have served me extremely well. I'm a college student and spend a lot of my time studying and listening to music. I live in a dorm and have three other roommates with desks within 5 feet of mine. Sitting and studying at my desk usually means that there is background conversation in the room or others playing music at a decent volume on their speakers. Putting these headphones on completely blocks that out. Turn noise cancellation up to ten and play music at about 50-70% volume and I can't hear a word of what anyone in the room is saying. They have started playing a game of how loud they have to say my name before I notice. They have to get very close to yelling occasionally when I am not paying attention and have the volume way up.As for the sound quality, I love it. I listen to everything from rap (heavy bass) to classical and orchestral pieces. I can confirm that the sound quality is consistent throughout genre, for some the bass may be slightly lacking but I find it to be more than enough.The Bose app is pretty much useless but it doesn't matter because all you need to do with it is set where you want your three noise cancelling levels to be and then never open the app again.The battery life is great I get the full 20 hours out of it even half a year later.One thing that I found surprisingly convenient is the included aux cord. Odd to purposely use Bluetooth headphones cabled I know but it does have its benefits. When travelling you can connect it to on board entertainment. And between when I got my Desktop computer and added bluetooth capability to it the aux cable came in handy.I love the case, granted it's slightly larger than the quiet comfort's but it's flatter which is nice. The hidden compartment is nice for housing the cables.Lastly is my only complaint about these headphones, I have a fairly large head already and big ears and yet these fit perfectly. That said the slides on either side that allow adjustability have become noticeably looser. They still work but it just means I have to readjust them to make them tighter about once every hour or two.

But I was wrong and heres why:These are exactly how every negative review speaks about:1. They are uncomfortable (even after stretching them over a period of nights). The clamping force is really there and unless you have a small head, it's not gonna be a good time.2. Sound quality is fine if you're looking for a neutral sound, but things are gonna feel like 'blurry' or 'muggy' sounding. Even basic tv shows, music, etc. It just feels off you know.3. You can really only get the functionality out of these when using their app that they force on you, and even then Bluetooth fails to connect, or takes FOREVER (on either ios or android). Sometimes it'll only connect to bluetooth LE and just wont play any sounds at all or just straight up won't connect. Whatever this thing is feeling at that particular moment is what you get.4. Touch controls are a pain. The double tap to pause play works fine to pause but to play again I have to hit the side of these things with the force of 5 gorillas and the double tapping speed of a spacex rocket. It's very frustrating. It just won't play otherwise. Also the volume controlls have no incrimental feature, the volume will just go up in down in these large increments. And also my finger like really drags on the earcups, it's not a smooth feeling like you would think.5. Sometimes it will just cause my music or show to just stop playing entirely. Like just pauses it without warning6. OMG THE SOUNDS THIS THING MAKES. When you turn it on, turn it off, when its connecting to something or loses connection. ITS LOUD. it will wake you up if you are falling asleep or it will make you leap out of your chair when you aren't expecting it. Thing of the music that's playing for the suspense for a horror movie leading up to the jump scare and just about when the music cuts out for the scare, it goes from low volume to high really quickly and then all quiet till you poop your pants... Yeah, thats the sound this makes. And you can't change it.7. They're not all that.The good:Noise cancellation is great, and the look is very nice and clean.

The audio quality is clear. They are fairly lightweight and balance the weight well between earcup pressure and the headband; resulting in a comfortable fit even if the cups are a bit shallow and my ears have to be tucked in just a bit to call these over-ear rather than on-ear headphones. They have rather strong active noise cancellation which is good because without them they have a pretty loud seashell effect. The battery only lasts me between .75 to 1.25 days of usage...

They needlessly double up the functionality of unlabeled buttons, causing confusion and lengthening the learning curve of using what should be 100% intuitive-When muting and unmuting yourself, you are unable to hear anything through the headphones for a couple of seconds while a voice says ""Muting""/""Unmuting"". Causes issues during meetings. Mute isn't a toggle switch so you can't tell if you're muted or not until you press it.There really isn't more innovation to be had from a pair of wireless headphones.

R1MORHVZP62XOQ,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars (Bose NC 700) Great overall,Alex,4,"I've had these headphones for about a year anda half and they've lasted longer than most of my headphones have in the past so they're definitely durable. The noise cancellation is great, I love that you can control the level of noise cancellation either with a button on the headphones or from the Bose Music app. The button switches between 10 (initial nc level when turned on), 5, then 0 and the app lets you set the nc at any level you want. The earpads are comfortable and don't squeeze your head but they only last roughly 4-6 months before they need to be replaced. The only real thing to complain about is that wind makes it hard to hear what you're trying to listen to because the headphones use a mic to let you hear your surroundings and anything stronger than a strong breeze will interfere with what you're trying to listen to","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2023",AGRQQEH574N3K6Q6CIE7BVZ23Q7A,True,5,Color: Black
R3JYWZSHYLD4FW,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancelling-inconsistent BT and terrible app - cushion seams fail in 30 months,T. Scott,3,"Updated on 8/16/22After a little over 2.5 years of almost daily use, the cushion cover on the left ear has come apart. See photo.Original Review:I primarily use headphones to listen to TV after my wife goes to bed. I use the noise canceling to filter out the hum of the air purifier in the room. I replaced my Cowin E7 ANC headphones. The Cowin replaced ZV-750 earbuds. I pair these with a 2 year old Samsung UN43MU63OF UHD Smart TV.First, the sound quality and noise canceling features are what I expect. I especially like the fact that the bass is more subdued than many headphones. I'm 74 and I am totally over the need for pounding bass :-). I also have minor hearing loss so understanding dialogue can be a problem, but NOT with these headphones. Furthermore the noise canceling cancels the hum of the air purifier. I also like the Conversation Mode feature that can turn the noise canceling and audio off with the touch of a button, carry on a conversation and then switch it back on -- no need to take the headphones off. I am TOTALLY satisfied with the listening experience.I also like that it annonces the battery level when you turn the phones and announces the names of the devices it is connected with. It can connect to two devices as well, so you can answer your phone while watching TV. I have not tried that feature, however. I do not use Alexa or Google Assistant, so I cannot comment on those features.What I am frustrated with is the inconsistency I have with connecting to the TV. Now to be honest, I have had problems with the BT connection on this TV with the other devices. However, the Cowin E7 had much fewer problems than my ZV-750. The Bose has had the most problems. Furthermore it is also has to be re-paired frequently. Not what you expect from a Bose product. Sometimes I have to get and walk 6 feet and stand next to the TV for it to connect.The other frustration is that the Bose Music app for IOS that you use to connect and configure the headphones is piece of crap. I found it confusing the first time I used it to connect to the headphones, but then found that it does not reconnect to the headphones automatically. Fortunately, you don't need the app after you have the few options setup on the phone, such as the 3 different noise canceling levels that can be controlled by the button on the headset, which voice assistant you want to use and the auto power off.I'm keeping the headset because I don't need the app to what I need and BT issues are not critical.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2020",AERAPR2T7E2Z4ZUDLEKMXRZ5HASA,True,0,Color: Black
R13N500KHOPAFR,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars High quality noise cancellation, and audio... when they're on!",Gabe I,4,"These are definitely quality headphones for phone calls and audio consumption, wired or wireless. I have used them wirelessly with a Pixel 3 XL and wired with an Oppo HA-2SE and NAD D7050.The noise cancellation is world class, as expected, and on par with the Sony WH1000XM3. The audio quality for music comes close to the Sony headphones, but only when the power is enabled and noise cancelling is on. If trying to listen to these passively when wired, the audio quality is very tinny and frankly unlistenable. However, once powered on with full (level 10) noise cancelling, these sound amazing.Microphone quality for phone calls is also amazing! Have not had any issues or complaints with the multiple conference calls I take for work. Living in NYC, I do not normally wear large headphones, especially noise cancelling, when walking in the street. Too many variables for potential injury.One specific con: The buttons are very easy to press when placing these on/picking them up from a desk. Particularly, the noise cancelling/ambient sound button, and the power button. The touch controls function well, but I have yet to see if they experience the phantom touches that plague the WH100XM3s in cold weather.When powering these on wired, they go through a series of start-up procedures. 1. The start up sound. 2. Battery life 3. Bluetooth connected or not. Essentially, these steps require 8 seconds before your music starts playing - unless you are listening passively with them off (not recommended due to the poor audio quality).Overall, phone calls are miles better than on the Sony WH1000XM3, however audio quality (and these do not support the same technology such as aptx) is not at the same level, unless they are powered on, which closes the gap substantially.If you are looking for a pair of headphones that is primarily used for phone calls and with a secondary purpose of music, these will fit the bill and then some. If you are strictly looking for noise cancelling headphones for music playback, then look towards the Sony WH1000XM3.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2019",AH2ZULPUIZ6G3WBVJHHGMQC7NIBQ,True,0,Color: Black
R32ZQK6N5X9L76,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, reliable connection, great noise cancellation. Battery life could be better.",IanB,5,"I bought these to replace a working pair of Quiet Comfort 25's to avoid cord hassles while on conference calls. The Bluetooth connection is quick and reliable. The microphone capability is noticeably better and walking around while on calls is really appreciated. I did notice that crumpling paper or running water (for dishes) are picked up very easily by my audience. They are comfortable and pretty good for listening to music while being available for calls. I have a pair of Beyer Dynamic headphones that are better, but I did not decrease the noise cancelling level on the Bose, so perhaps the difference will not be as great when adjusted. I did get a call on my phone while on a Zoom meeting that allowed folks to hear my phone call, which I've learned to avoid. The Bluetooth seems to allow for two devices only, not more. The controls on the ear cups are good, but not always picked up the first time; make contact with a finger relatively firmly and move deliberately and it works. The battery life is not as long as the AAA battery in the 25's and is fixed in place, rechargeable with a USB-C cable. The fixed battery and frequent cycling makes me think that they will not last as long as my 25's. I got them during Prime Day, so the price was more than acceptable for the freedom of movement and improved microphone. I'm pretty happy with these and would recommend them at the price point (and especially so when lower!) if they last a few years.","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2022",AFXYDZWFWXTXYHLEREPP5VUR5MBQ,True,4,Color: Black
R2BPSXEKN94DD7,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great audio quality, phone app is glitchy, had problems working with some PC app",Dave,3,"I listened to a music selection with two other headphones I have, and comparatively, I found the Bose 700 a step above the Avantree ANC031 in terms of audio quality and a few steps above in noise cancellation, but not really ""better"", so much as different in audio quality when compared with the Anker SoundCore Strike 3 headphones, which do not have noise cancellation. The Avantree sound is nice but comparatively muffled compared to the clearer, brighter, more articulated sound in the Bose 700. However, I like the bass, mid and treble quality of the Anker headset more than the Bose, being that the Strike 3's bass, mid and treble ranges sound is not only more balanced, but also fuller, and for lack of a better word, more robust. This may be because the Strike 3 is built for gaming and producing 7.1 surround sound, predisposing any music to sounding more immersive and all encompassing, but I personally like hearing music in that way. I realize the Strike 3's is wired, not wireless (the Bose 700 is both), the Strike 3's mic is extended and detacheable, with really good noise-cancelling, voice-isolating capability, vs. the Bose 700 having a built-in noise-cancelling mic. The two products are made for different users - someone who needs to be mobile or stationary and someone who's just stationary. But if I had to just sit down, I can detach the mic from the Anker and enjoy its audio just as much as the 700.The reason I gave the Bose less than 5 stars, though is because of the problems I had with the Bose Music app. Too many times, my smartphone would say I'm connected to the headphones and I'd hear Spotify playing, but the Bose Music app would say I'm not connected. Or it just wouldn't consistently connect to the headphones. I also had problems getting the 700's mic to work with Microsoft Teams and Google Voice on my Windows 10 PC. I was looking for top-notch headphones that I could connect to my PC communications applications, as well as reliably work my smartphone and the 700 didn't do that for me. But if you're just looking to use the 700 with your smartphone and you're willing to play with occasional glitches in syncing the app to the actual state of the headphones, the audio quality is great. The 700's noise cancellation levels are noticeably different and its very useful to adjust the cancellation level to let in the surrounding noise if you have to pay attention to occasional sounds around you, like waiting to hear an announcement over an intercom or listening for your child's voice.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2020",AH3WLUECA5T3OAHVBLZLJT2O37MA,True,1,Color: Black

R2PEFS7JWI8R7X,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply the best headphones you will ever buy,Jeff Capron,5,"First of all, the top review for this product is all wrong. You do NOT need the app for these headphones to function. I had never even used the app for the first month of using these. Either this was once a requirement and is not now, or that reviewer is not telling the truth. You CAN use the app to tweak a bunch of settings, but honestly, it works just fine right out of the box.These are hands down, the best headphones I have ever had and I have tried nearly a dozen over the last 8 years. The sound is absolutely life-like. The mic is studio quality. I use these each and every day for work and play.The battery times are just awesome. The description says 20 hours, but for me, the most I have ever gotten is 18 hours but I am using the mic a lot, so I wouldn't be surprised if I got 20 hours if the mic was not in use.I had many headphones with supposed noise cancellation. I came to the conclusion that this was just a scam feature UNTIL I got this set. It is almost scary how well it works. I have a home office and the family makes noise that interrupts my work but with these on, I hear none of that. In fact, they often startle me when they come in the office to tell me something and have to touch my shoulder so I know they are there. I never thought I would enjoy a ""scam"" feature so much.I think it is a shame that the most ""helpful"" review of this headset is blatantly wrong.

R3SG6G65ZZ0SN8,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Destroyed by corporate greed and stupidity,Jonathan H. Schatz,1,"Hi, as an update to the original review (below), I want to just emphasize how angry I am with myself for not returning these in time for refund.Before buying, I want you to think about the following: Bose wants you to pay more than $300 for a pair of headphones with features that you CANNOT DEACTIVATE. 1) The voice assistant button, constantly being activated at unwanted times, you may not choose ""none of the above"" or ""off"" for this feature. Not allowed. 2) The absolutely hopeless gesture controls. THERE IS NO OPTION TO DEACTIVATE THEM. You will be constantly playing, skipping, restarting movies, songs, videos, by scratching your head, taking the item on or off. The cat now has the power to advance your audiobook a few chapters while you're not even in the room.Just image the sheer arrogance that went into this specific decision in the design of this product. We will introduce new features, and we just can't get over how awesome we think they are. In fact, we're so proud of ourselves we will shove them down your throat. It's a $320 pair of headphones, and you the user do not have the ability to control them in a full and customized manner! It's COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, and I will NEVER purchase another Bose product.These headphones have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. That better be automatic for the price.Why one star? Operation of this item is a disaster. As others have mentioned, you are required to install and use for all substantial settings changes (such as switching between devices) a smart-phone app. Although the app itself is reasonably functional so far, you are required to register and give away ALL control over data about you that will be collected and sold to highest bidders. If you were a business, would you be satisfied with getting people to pay $320 for a pair of headphones? Well, it's not enough for the insatiable vampire of greed that is the Bose Corp. You will be milked at every turn through exploitation of personal data over which you may have no control whatsoever. (Read the terms. It's an impressive piece of more or less shameless corporate skullduggery.)That's not the real deal-breaker, though. The gesture controls are a nightmare. Want to adjust volume? You must wave your finger in a magical way and hope for the best. Occasionally the volume goes in the desired direction, although precise control (i.e. small jumps) is not even possible. The rest of the time, something else will happen -- pause, skip to end or beginning of song, video, or even entire movie. Hitting the gestures along with some of the buttons unintentionally at other times is nearly impossible. Nothing like setting your headphones aside for a while to come back and find your audiobook has been playing the whole time, and good look getting back to where you actually left off.The gesture controls CANNOT BE TURNED OFF. IT'S NOT AN OPTION. Google the discussions on this around various forums (including Bose's own). If you want to wear the headphones under a hood, there will be a constant stream of unwanted gesture control inputs with head movements. Read the nightmare stories from people in cold rainy climates with the misfortune to have purchased this item.Don't use a voice assist program like Siri or Alexa? Well for this item turns out ""none of the above"" again is NOT AN OPTION when you set up the device and are asked to choose your assistant. As a result, because of the particularly poor location of the voice assist button, you'll regularly be talking to one whether you like it or not. (I now know Siri's responses to a wide variety of profanity-laced invective.)In sum, some sort of corporate group-think decision process led to a conclusion that forcing neato (but really not ready for prime time) features on users was the way to go. Completely inexcusable for an item at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2021",AHA7R2SM4CRBVLBWBUVO72DCJ6FQ,True,22,Color: Black

RBAZBP0AEJ7MI,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars A Bargain at this Price point,Theraphosa,5,"I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGLZUTDNQGTB7SYDWEKICNA7753Q,True,77,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RN9CWLAVNRL0V,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Better Than XM5,b,5,"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2023",AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,True,697,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1RRDWF3JCZOPG,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars What world?,FaTHoM,5,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2022",AEZI5ES3LFYNSNHLSU3EN4T3SC6A,True,143,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1BHDNEFJ0AW20,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars SONY WH-1000XM4... BEST HEADPHONES EVER,moo,5,"I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.Getting back on topic...The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4. Five stars!","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020",AENRBQDUJTCE2UXIKUQAGJ4JH7EA,True,107,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1Z8K8GMOUV106,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!,Bradley,5,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2021",AFKIZZFUQDOWZ72ZQFX6UJBSPDCQ,True,154,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
R38T61DMMWO74Q,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sony WH-1000XM4 vs. Bose 700 vs. Jabra Evolve2 65, mostly for Zoom meetings",Michael23,4,"I was looking for headphones for work and personal usage. I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021",AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,True,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1U65T3UFWZLG4,B0863TXGM3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product, Great Customer Service - Best Overall Headphones",Lio,5,"Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2021",AFPLI4FFCUNPV4VG7D7ZEEUI3OPQ,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R8H3J5IAMVQYO,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars My review is effectively these should be xm 3.1 not 4 build but good otherwise.,s,5,"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video. Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful. That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s. By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great. I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same.

R3D4YJSFPEC0YM,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls",TechPicky,4,"A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program. While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review. Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make. A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones. The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent. This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available. The Bluetooth range is also exceptional. Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone. They have long battery life and charge quickly. They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful. There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush. However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.) If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses. They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously. The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time. I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones. I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app. I was then able to play music from the MacBook. I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something. It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky. Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch. Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device. Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where. This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35. I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device. It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device. Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2. The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app. This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices. It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices. You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device. You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected. You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent. It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another. The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent. For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable. Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response. More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep. You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight. The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies. Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified. Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment. These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment. High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences. I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones. They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier. That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth. The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth. I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones. They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing. The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound. Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good. Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet. This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS. You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it. You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play. I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better. To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature. This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content. I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music. It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better. At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies. It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable. This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used. The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal. I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup. I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic. There was some front/rear placement depth. It was interesting to play with for a while. What I found though is that it just sounded strange. I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical. Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable. It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above. Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks. Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical. By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations. With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls. They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with. Most people said I sounded fine. I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone. They said I sounded “far away.” On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19. This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation. I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35. At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call. My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these. I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these. I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring! Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music. I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane. Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice. They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls). These definitely exceed the rated battery life. With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use. I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge. Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable. On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic. It is more than enough though. It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use. Almost any other use it should be more than enough. I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector. They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply. They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it). You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging. I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity. They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power. In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick. It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones. The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable. Simple buttons would have been much better. Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing. You try and turn the volume down and track changes. To be fair, they do have a volume control. The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right. Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume. Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume. Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that. I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times. Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device. It will then want to pair with Bluetooth. I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt. If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app). You could just say Alexa and it worked. You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would. It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app. The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though. This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content. It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume. Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems. This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better. It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google). I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying. At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard. This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode. While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode. This mostly works. In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it. Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode. There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet. You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while. Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control. This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions. This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc. I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying. It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions. This can be disabled in the app. If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well. (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones. Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual. The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more. You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears. I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK. It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information. It shows battery level, and the current codec in use. This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details. Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35. It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system. The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling. It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2020",AE7DZ3XTVG6DTUFU2KBE52MDPL4A,True,576,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2RUMUO1GMQ7JX,B0863TXGM3,3.0 out of 5 stars Not everything I ever dreamed of...,Andrew Cousineau,3,"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHVIBRANSX6ITQCAF6SA5XNMQNAA,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R17KWZY74P83HQ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Solid For Out-of-Office,Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesThere’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,66,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RJE80FBWZNCH6,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R709TK5SYB7PC,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great,Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020",AGY3FKXCB7VCVYWXHL4MLDKIBUUQ,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2USDO6PGSXOSG,B0863TXGM3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!",John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020",AFDEU4TPM7P7QRC7HKAXHD4O5L3Q,True,41,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R28ULTR4EVN00O,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but be aware of quirks and limitations",T. Apuzzo,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:Pros:+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.Cons:- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature insteadEqual:* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4Personal Preference:* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AGNOHQRHY74UUQ6YUYPHD5MWD6JA,True,17,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

R1NL6NRC83D8N1,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Audiophile Perspective,A. Matthewson,4,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).- Mobility.- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.Cons:- Price.- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.- Ears can become warm after a while.- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2020",AEHBO45A5VT7QL4WOIMAXEQOW26Q,True,21,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

R32NKDVGVF2QPR,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Not easy to increase the volume using the headphone by sweeping up on the right earmuff, just use the TV volume buttons.

Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings. TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds.Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4- Seamless connection - prefer SONY- Comfort - prefer Sony- Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose.

Running and walking are great however, the Touch Sensor Control is not ideal for me, especially when using while exercising. I find the controls/sensor unforgiving and one misstep can restart a song and or podcast, other than they continue to work very well.Used these headphones for a extended 12+ hrs flight and another 9 hour flight.. great noise canceling and sound.

R3LOW0OAVZVPNN,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling, everything else is ok",MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AGXVB4UEYOJCFXO6XR45I52IWWWQ,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1JKUN1J8FVF5H,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beast Headphones, solid Noise-cancelling/ beautiful sound/ Comfort.. But don't pay full price.",xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.Pros:When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.Cons:Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.Noise-CancellingTo anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.ConnectivityI've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)AppPretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFY3JHUWWTAHBJZNBVXSOOORVGMQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2D8OVJ75Z7DSP,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars 1000 hr review,C Stribs,5,"Alright, So I have put alot of time into these 1000xm4s over the last three months. These headphones are fantastic! However it took me about 50-100 hours to get used to them. I'll explain. So I have owned cheap ""noise canceling"" TAO Tonic $40 black friday special wireless headphones and I had good wired $200 Sennheiser 599 open ear headphones. My previous experiences with headphones were to get the most out of the audio or to cancel out noise I needed to near max out sound volume and reach deafening thresholds. After listening to these headphones I started to realize I needed to change the way I was using these headphones. First of all the app is nice. You can adjust the EQ to custom or use a preset EQ setting. I chose to turn of the speak-to-chat as it would easily pick up my voice if I was singing along or making any loud adublie sound while working out. But getting back on track I found that I could listen to music, podcasts, Netflix ect at a very low level and hear everything perfectly. I was so use to staying at a 80-90 percent volume from my previous headphones that I was at little sad that the 80-90 level on this headset didn't sound as loud as my older headphones. Simply put these bad boys do such a great job noise canceling that you can clearly hear audio at very low levels. You may not feel alot of punchy bass with them (it's there though) you also won't hear any distortion even bumped to max levels. Also, these Sonys will automatically and continuously track your environment and adjust noise canceling and ambient sounds according to if your laying in bed or get up to a walk, or sitting a plane ect. They will also save you hearing as well but sadly not your bank account. If you plan to work out with them they will be a solid option. Again I haven't heard any distortion while working out or on a treadmill, bike, or rowing machine. Since they are closed ear style they may get warm on your head. I always get a q-tip out and swipe off the sweat condensation that accumulates inside the left ear cup on the plastic ear sensor after workouts (I dont know if this is recommended). I haven't had any issues with them slipping off my head either. The hand and swipe gestures take a little time to get used to but work well. Every now and then the swipe forward/backward and up/down to skip tracks or volume doesnt work but I feel this is user error on my part. The cover over the right headphone is a cool feature. It will easily flood ambient sound in allowing you to quickly and temporarily converse with someone or you could leave the speak to chat feature on. Additionally you receive a nice hard carrying case, charger brick, usb-C cable, and aux cord. I've used the aux cord quite a bit with my nintendo switch and it does a great job. Also the 1000xm4s are very forgiving if you forget to plug them in when runinng low on power. In 10mins I can quick charge them to last about10hours. I think the specs say 3 hours till 100% charge but I swear I had my headphones fully charged in about 1 hour. They are dual voltage which has been great for traveling abord. Lastly you can connect up to two Bluetooth devices which at time. Honestly I didn't think I would even need this feature. However I found out it is very convenient for seemlesly swapping devices or getting notifications from my phone/watch while connected to my laptop or when I'm bluetooth connected to my switch. So they are a great pair of headphones but you will take a hit to bank account. I picked up a open box Amazon return which knocked off over $100 on the price and the headphones came without any issues. If you see these on a decent sale I would scoop up a pair. Also if you want more of a punchy bass type headphones I would also recommend XBN-900N which I tested out shortly and you can tell they are more focused on bass bumping. I believe they are significantly cheaper new but don't have all of the same features.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2022",AH4Y52RTEYUMLCRPZVE3UJLJBNRQ,True,26,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021",AGR7CTQV4ETCIWAPZDP42W5V6EQA,True,3,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

Sticking with my Bose QC 35 Series I",Dennis,2,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020",AFERWW2A4UHMJIFE23HMMIJL2SXA,True,1914,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2H9OCEJ7LGCV4,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent set of headphones,Chis,5,"I can't compare these to other sets in their class, what I can say is that they are so good, I don't even need to consider trying a different set. I use them at my desk for work as well as while traveling.For work, they are very, very comfortable and don't cause soreness or headaches like other headphones I have used in the past. I have gone thru multi day planning sessions where I was in meetings almost the entire day and they were excellent. I also love how I don't have to charge them when using the wire to connect them to my work laptop. Noise canceling doesn't work, but the fact that they are over the ear headphones as it is, I can't easily hear background noise from my home office.I recently took them on my first trip. The battery life was great, didn't need to recharge them the entire trip. The noise cancelling technology was absolutely fantastic, even if I didn't have any media playing they were solid. At times, I forgot I was even on a plane. The case for them is very good, holds them nicely and was sturdy enough to hold up while in my bag.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AE5QJKPHRX3RAXLFZ5QD5LAS7URQ,True,3,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1JJLGFUZ7LMKT,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've ever owned but -1 star for several minor usability issues,Tayne,4,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLYOne of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKSIt seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2020",AGEKBKA2Z63J7U3URXIPCFNZQOGQ,True,379,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

They work amazing with my Bravia tv, so I use them when I don’t want to wake everyone up while I’m watching tv or playing ps5. They make great ps5 wireless headphones- but only because they Bluetooth to the tv. They don’t connect directly to the ps5. Battery life is well over 10 hours. Sound is really good, noise cancellation feature is pretty amazing. I can hear my music at a relatively low volume while mowing.

I was sold and bought a pair this XM4 unit before a long international flight. It was amazing. The turbine whine that I find incredibly fatiguing was GONE. Further, using this for an in-flight movie did allowed the volume to be 50% with excellent quality. Using only earbuds, I needed the volume to be at 100%.This is an absolute must-have for any flight and they are a tad less expensive than the comparable Bose model.

First time with fancy headphones so I cant really compare to others, but they sound amazing and are pretty comfortable. I can usually go 3ish hours before I have to take a break comfort wise. The battery is fantastic (only indicates in 10% increments), and probably gets about 12-15 hours before it hits 50%. The noise canceling is very nice too, and you can put your hand over the side of it which is great to hear random conversations without taking them off, albeit you look pretty dumb. I’ve been too afraid to work out with them because it says they arent waterproof/resistant, so no input on that aspect.

R24CNHZWHJRWOV,B0863TXGM3,"3.0 out of 5 stars GREAT for Music -- BAD for Calls, Teams, etc",David Diskin,3,"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AFYFHYV5S7I7LYF7JRA63MPQGDTA,True,29,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2JMIRC62ED8BT,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Saying Goodbye to Bose...,Kaladin Stormblessed,4,"I've been pro-Bose for YEARS (QC35's being the most recent headphones). Not necessarily for the booming bass/audio quality, but for the convenience factor (on the go, on the plane, zoom meetings, etc...), excellent battery life + amazing noise cancellation. To balance, I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (though oddly designed), sound great both via Bluetooth or cabled/analog via a DragonFly, playing FLAC, etc...Well..., my QC35's encountered the infamous always-on ""feature."" Flipping the button to off will give you an audible beep that it's being powered off, only to find that you missed 20 calls in your log that you never heard ring. If you're under warranty, you're golden (they'll offer to fix or a discounted upgrade). If not, you're forced to operate with miniature tools under a magnifying glass to bend the button contact points to maintain constant connectivity to the board. My QC35's were months out of warranty & I was SOL... Hacked per all the DIY vids which worked well for about 6 months. Earlier this week, however, I noticed several missed calls + the Bluetooth connection active. Sure enough, the Bose were ""back at it again..."" Didn't feel like hacking for another 6 month band-aid, so seriously considered picking up a pair of 700's. My coworkers, however, (the same ones who all originally had/suggested Bose), said they switched to Sony months ago... After researching pros & cons/side-by-side comparisons, the WH-1000XM4's seemed more & more a worthy competitor/option...Go-To Amazon of course had the WH-1000XM4's in-stock (& $60 cheaper than the Bose!), so ordered without hesitation. Headphones arrived (packaging & product) looking very slick (nice touch w/ the rose gold accents on black. Charged for about 30 minutes, then tested audio & call quality... BLOWN AWAY... Streaming music, movies, etc... seemed lightyears beyond what I subjected myself to w/ the Bose. My QC35's sounded flat & bass was non-existent. These headphones feel like I'm back in the mid 90's, cruising in my lowered Accord on wire wheels, bumping my Cerwin Vegas powered from an M100 Phoenix Gold Amp w/ Boston Acoustic pro series highs/mids. Yes, ""slight"" exaggeration (anyone w/ 12"" Vega's know what I'm talking about), but it DID take me back... Beyond impressed... No issues w/ audio quality as well on my Zoom's or direct bt to my phone.So..., audio quality is OUTSTANDING... What caught me off guard, however, was the noise cancellation! I thought Bose was amazing, but Sony's latest technology is on another level. It works so well, it's scary... Damn near can't hear a thing when they're on. Without any audio at all, it's as if you're trapped in ""soundproof vacuum purgatory,"" with nothing but you & your now blaringly loud tinnitus to keep you company. When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, you (to be continued: Apparently, my family has been calling my name for the last 10 minutes. They gave up & sent my youngest upstairs to physically wave her hands in front of me @ my workstation to tell me we're eating soon. Yes, the noise cancellation is THAT good). Ok, continuing where I left off above: When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, your ears are now hyper-sensitive to every day sounds. Birds chirping, humming of video equipment, the heater, etc... I always assumed that Bose was the leader in this technology, but Sony just knocked it out of the park...As far as cons? Very minimal & more of annoyances if anything... I use mine strictly for voice & audio (though I did install the app), so not really taking advantage of any of the advanced features. The Bose has a massive R & L inside the padding + the on/off switch is an easy queue as to which side is R or L. The Bose padding at the top of your head also appears to be a bit firmer/more comfortable. With the Sony, the buttons are camouflaged into speakers & the R & L are tiny (but color coded) markers on the inner headset. Marking is tiny, but as long as you associated Red with Right, then you're golden. Also, after a prolonged period of time, the very top of my head was throbbing/sore. I'd have to raise the headset slightly to give the to of my skull a break. Again, these are merely minor annoyances & the pros far outweigh the cons...Can't really say much more & for those TLDR, Sony's WH-1000XM4 put my Bose QC35's to shame (voice, audio & outstanding noise cancellation). Not sure how long these suckers will last, but assuming they stand the test of time, I don't see any reason why I'd ever return to Bose...","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2020",AEYBZLL2AJCLTZWVTP6LC5TMDDBA,True,21,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R3D37IETBXFZQP,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth Headphones I've had so far...,Daniel Meadows,5,"I have purchased and used a variety of wireless, over-ear style headphones over the years, but the Sony WH-1000XM4 (XM4's from here on), have provided a great experience so far! For simplicity's sake, I will only directly mention the other Sony pair I currently own, the XB900N.Note:This review is after one full (out of the box) charge. They lasted almost exactly three days after fairly heavy use. Material used during this period varied from heavy rock to classical, audiobooks, and videos from YouTube. Sections in the review are in CAPS for organization, not emphasis.The Positive:+ SOUND is phenomenal on these. Out of the box, they were almost on par with other sets I had set equalizer preferences for. Once the equalizer profiles were created for the XM4's, the music started sounding better than it ever has before through Bluetooth. These clearly favor a warm sound, and shine best when paired with bass heavy tracks, but all of my library has gotten some noticeable benefit from the XM4's.Sound is different for everyone, but these seem better out of the box than most I've tried, and custom profiles are easy to create with the Sony app.+ CONNECTIVITY was extremely easy. I had already installed the Sony companion app for headphones from the XB pair I had used before. I have not had any dropped connections so far.+ BUILD QUALITY feels like a pretty big step up from the XB900N's. Sturdy cans and a very soft headband are a nice combination. I've only had the XM4's for three days but I feel they will hold up fairly well. Considering I've had the XB pair for over a year with no noticeable degradation, I have high expectations here. The XM4's come with a great travel case too.The Neutral (still positive to me):1. CHARGING CORD is short. I like it because it is now the easiest charging cord to identify out of all the ones I currently use. The cord it is packaged with limits flexibility for charging locations, but is also perfectly functional for my needs.2. ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) function is good, almost too good. I have used these headphones a lot since I received them three days ago, and the first thing I noticed when I put them on- the ANC was overwhelming. I became somewhat queasy as soon as I turned them on. Once I opened the app I noticed there was a calibration tool for ANC. Once I went through that process, I no longer felt discomfort when using this feature. YMMV, but these block out most noise in my home, to the point it's just music or the book I'm listening to. I'm still getting used to how strong the ANC actually is.3. BATTERY LIFE was pretty good, but may have been somewhat under 100% out of the box, despite the headphones declaring a full charge when activated. I did not time my usage, but I probably got around 18 to 20 hours on the initial charge. Some settings for music quality and DSEE (sound enhancement for some content) will lower battery life according to Sony's companion app. It advised against using my settings for the best battery life experience. I appreciated but also ignored this advice. I know I won't be getting the full battery life from it, but it sounds so good! I'm leaving this detail under neutral to see if I get the same- or better - performance from a true 100% charge. Edit: lasted about the same, maybe one additional hour. Still good for daily, heavy use.4. TOUCH CONTROLS are a big debate among users of Bluetooth headphones. I happen to like how responsive these are, but I've also really liked some other headphones out there that had good old fashioned dials and buttons. I don't know which I prefer over the other, but the touch controls for the XM4's are not bad.The Negatives:- These get pretty warm. Ultimately, it isn't an issue to me because I wear glasses and they are still comfortable, just warm after longer sessions.Overall:The best Bluetooth headphones I've come across! Definitely worth the price on sale. The XM4's do not disappoint and provide truly top-tier ANC functionality. My new favorite headphones for music and audiobooks on the go.Thank you for reading my review!Hopefully the XM4's are finished recharging by now.Have a great day!","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2021",AFXQD236J4IAIPMMDUVPGYEZ6PNA,True,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R1QCC0WCTVPPPJ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Quiet,EliteTek IT,4,"Scroll to the bottom for pros and cons!The amazing sound produced by these Headphones can only be matched by the perfection of the ACN(Active Noise Canceling). With dynamic control from an app on your device to to the touch controls on the earpiece, ease of use is definitely a bonus feature. Sony spared no expense in attempting to build a lightweight comfortable headset and they succeeded.I purchased these headphones for a couple different reasons. First and foremost was for a long international flight I was preparing to take, and second was for a gym alternative to my AirPods. Though I have nothing against the AirPods, I was tired of sticking things in my sweaty ears.The first thing I noticed about these Sony headphones was the Dolby Atmos surround sound clarity. I first tested them in my home with my laptop making sure the Bluetooth connection was solid and clean. I was amazed at the dynamic range of sound and the realistic sound placement while watching high action scenes. I literally felt like I could look around and see the gunmen.The second thing I noticed was the amazing quality of the ACN which can be adjusted for sound pass through in the app. While walking through the airport, my phone lost signal for a moment and i immediately feared the headphones were the issue. As I removed them from my ears I was shocked at how loud the airport was. People talking, jets whirring up to taxi, the voice over the PA had been completely shut out. I put them back on my ears again and took them off several times marveling at the difference. Now that my childlike wonder was satisfied and it was time to board my plane.While waiting for taxi I listened to the cabin taking in all sounds and soon found myself dying to drown out the noise again. I set the pass through to about half sensitivity and put them back on. After some adjustment in the app I was able to find a perfect balance of cabin announcements and my music (Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, Morgan Whalen for reference).Ultimately over the course of the next 24 hours these headphones never left my head. I only needed to place them on to the charger after landing at the destination. Yes I was awake the whole time attempting to counteract jet lag. Conversely on the return trip I used nothing but the ACN to drown out noise and I slept comfortably(as you can on a plane) with them on the whole way home. These headphones completely stopped the drone of the engines and made for an enjoyable listening experience.The only thing that has disappointed me regarding my Sony Headphones is their functionality during active gym sessions. Though they were not excessively hot, sweat tended to make the earpieces very slick. They would slide around and even off while lying in horizontal positions such as bench press or push ups. In both sessions I wore these I found myself paying way more attention to trying to find a way to stop the slipping that I eventually took them off midway through the second session due to annoyance.Overall for lightly active people(walkers, hikers, traveling by car plane train) these headphones are a great sound at a great value. My only reason for a 4 star rating is the inability to use them functionally in the gym. (Yes I know there is nothing that claims these are for active wear)Pros:-comfort-lightweight-great battery life-ACN works wonderfully-Amazing Bluetooth range-convenient folding design makes storage easyCons:- not meant for active individuals that sweat.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023",AFDGGVDZE73UGIVTZLZNANPP7NDA,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R161CZ0PS65QJQ,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones! The best!!!!!,Janel MH,5,"So let's get the cons out of the way: pricey, but worth it!If hooking up Bluetooth headphones through a Bluetooth transmitter (for me I use one for my tv that doesn’t have Bluetooth), have to not download headphone app and make sure your phone doesn’t hook up to it via phone Bluetooth and you need to “forget this device” on your phone.For me I am not going to use these with my iPhone, so I deleted the app and did as above so my phone wouldn’t detect it, otherwise it’s hard to get it to connect to the transmitter. I don’t need the app that Sony suggests to download anyway because that is just for ambient and sound control/extras. More convenient if you do use headphones with your phone.Any more cons? I can think of any!Pros: a lot! I love these. I previously purchased cheap Bluetooth headphones from Amazon but wish I have got these sooner. The cheaper ones are ok but the ear pads hurt my ears after wearing them after an hour or two.I’ve only used these Sony headphones a couple times but after an hour my ears don’t hurt! The earpads are comfortable and fit over my ears well.As I said before, it’s easy to connect via Bluetooth transmitter(or whatever blue tooth you are hiking up to) after I deleted the app, if I want to watch tv.It’s hard to tell in the instructions with no words(I guess a con) but I looked it up in you tube, and while the headphones are on, press and hold (the on/off button)until the voice lady says Bluetooth pairing. This is a good tip because I didn’t get that right away. And then it connected!Was easy to reconnect as well using it another day.I can also listen to my tv and have the noise cancelling on and the same time! It’s great! I don’t even hear any traffic from outside or if someone has their subwoofer on in their car! It’s a game changer and a life saver.The noise cancelling is great in general also. And can be turned off if needed by pressing the button over the on/off button. Can also be switched to ambient sound.Overall these are the best headphones I’ve had. And totally forgot how good Sony was. I know back in the day I had a Walkman and cd Walkman and they were the bras knees. The Sony brand has always been good. They are still the best for electronics in my opinion.Another con I just thought of is the changes cord could be longer.Pro: comes with a nice fabric case and plug if if you want it wired an adapter for airplanes, etc.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AGMSTFZ2H4KOB6D42AJN6YH7U6FA,True,9,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

R3V25GSVN3M9AR,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Excellent sound & Comfort, Subpar Ergonomics, Auto-Shut Off Does Not Work as Expected",Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2021",AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

They are very lightweight and are alright to use for several hours on flights and at work.The touch controls work very well, and quickly responds without any error. I like that there is a sensor in the ear cup to pause your content, and via the app you can have it automatically transmit conversations. Though I found it a little too sensitive and annoying.I would recommend the app for EQ adjustment and function adjustments. I dislike it has a name which doesn't correlate in my mind, and I always forget what it is called.The headphones sound good, they are great for audio books, and musical, just not my favorite to listening to music. They have a good level of detail, but they seem to be balanced more for mid-range tones.The noise cancelation is OK, it makes annoying sounds a little dimmer, but like most, it sounds like a hollow, more tolerable tone of the noise.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2024",AFZGTBBAM6FJDZ272EWAEO4WOSLQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2V6FCX5P6469V,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good Headphones,Amazon Customer,5,"These headphones have very good sound quality and feel well made. They arrived in nice packaging, and the carrying case they come with is decently compact and also good quality. I've had them for 1.5 years now, and after daily, extensive use, they are still doing fine. I may have to replace the ear pads in the next year, but that's an easy process and only around $20 for replacement parts. I got these on sale, and I recommend anyone interested wait for a prime or sale day for them to go on sale for like $200. They charge very quickly and last me a good couple days of all-day use on a full charge, even after 1.5 years. I'm not one to go into the equalizer and change stuff, so the basic sound settings sound great to me. The noise cancelling is good on transit and in the office. On transit or airplanes, it's also nice that you can hold your hand to the right ear, and it will enhance any announcements while quieting the music, so you don't have to actually remove the headphones. Noise cancelling in general doesn't do much for talking sounds, but the ear pads cup the ear and head nicely so you can't hear talking much either.One thing I wish they could change is the feedback beep the headphones make whenever you interact with the touch pad on the right ear. I get some people might appreciate it, but I spent a while when I first got the headphones trying to figure out how to turn it off. I got used to it after a month or so, but I had hoped for a bit more customizability. Tap to pause, a quiet beep, tap to play, another beep. Kind of unnecessary in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AHOIGZCV3TMG6IAGC3SOFNHBWVAQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R2NRCSDUHP4IOM,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Comfort, But Some Reliability Issues",Christopher J. Giannelli,4,"I recently purchased my second pair of these noise-canceling headphones, and I've had enough time to thoroughly evaluate their performance. Here's my take on them:Pros:Comfort: They're incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions.Appearance: The black design is sleek and aesthetically pleasing.Build Quality: These headphones feel high quality and durable, built to last.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is nothing short of spectacular. It effectively blocks out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.Multi-Device Connectivity: Being able to connect to two devices simultaneously is a game-changer. It's a convenience that sets these headphones apart from others I've owned.Sound Quality: The audio and music sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass and clear treble that make for an awesome listening experience.Cons:High-Pitched Squealing: My first pair occasionally emitted a high-pitched squealing noise. It was so severe that I had to power them off. Unfortunately, the issue sometimes persisted even after turning them back on, leading me to purchase a second pair.Connectivity Issues: After about a year, my new pair began to experience connectivity problems, suddenly stopping audio playback. The only workaround is to power them off and back on, which is quite frustrating and happens all too often.Not ideal for working out: When doing horizontal exercises, like push ups, bench press, rows, etc. these tend to fall off because of the weight. If you're upright however, these are great. Although I'm not sure how the sweat effects them over time, hopefully that won't damage them?Overall:Despite the drawbacks, I genuinely love these headphones. They offer superior comfort, sound quality, and the unique ability to connect to two devices at once. However, I've encountered reliability issues with both pairs I've owned, from the distressing squealing noise in the first pair to connectivity problems in the second. While I would still recommend them for their outstanding features and performance, I do hope the manufacturer addresses these reliability issues in future models.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFFMUCTTNHASAJ3W3YURACQ4ALUA,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R2SUXCOAV9YSTQ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with minor complaints,Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2021",AFVRXTQ5UZV3R4X6CIHDRIC676HQ,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AE3XOTZX4POH3IUEKKHWWSFNO4GQ,True,4,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R3SAGQ8WM36T2B,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - 1st Class Noise Cancelling,Eyeconic,5,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation.I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup.I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head.My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids.I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies.On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone).The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE. Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing.One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter.So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2023",AGUUWIFY7DIFIWQRWV2JKBCOWEIQ,True,71,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R2VY38AB0K4XQ8,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Would recommend,Yanet,5,"I bought these in December so I haven't had these for long. The overall experience is amazing and Ive been loving my music a lot more but the headphones leak noise once you exceed a certain volume so if you're putting them in blast everyone will hear what you're listening to. The only thing I can compare it to are my AirPods pros but between the two I would go with these headphones, you really get to feel the music and feel like you're really there.The headphones feel like you could easily break with a single wrong move or turn them the wrong way, they do provide a case so you're fine putting them in a bag, but it's large and bulky, so if you're carrying a lot of things in your bag it most defiantly will take a lot of your space. I haven't used it for working out but I personally wouldn't because it slides off my head whenever I look down or move too quickly so it does get irritating.Overall I say buy these headphones if you to really change the way you listen to music, if you're a generally a careful person there shouldn't be a reason for them to break, they just feel a little cheap for the price you pay for. I've loved them as a college student.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2024",AEHDGDHXYDJKLKH2NZBB4UMIDHQA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R3P26OHTQWKSVU,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfection. Close...but no ciggar!,A VERY private person,5,"This item has everything you'd want to have in a noise cancelling device: great sound, good level of noise reduction. BTW, it does NOT cancel the background noise - it reduces it to very low levels. You might not notice it, though, if you're the kind of person who listens full blast to your rap or metallica music.The headphones work great in an airplane. They successfully knocked off the engines noise, and even attendants' voices on a 5-hour flight to N. Carolina. The headphones come with airplane adapters, so you can hook them up to the airplane's entertainment center. The fit is also good - I didn't feel any pressure points over my ears or on my head, where the headband rests.Where the noise reduction doesn't work well is in windy conditions. If you ride a bicycle, run, or walk in some wind, you will hear the wind no matter how you set up the noise reduction. This is because of the position of the microphones that sample the outside noise - they are at the top of each ear cup (the oval openings), and thus, in the path of the wind.The user can answer a phone call, and have a nice chat over the phone while wearing the headphones. However, (s)he cannot start a call like you can with other dedicated headphones. I don't believe it's a big issue because I check the phone anyway, to see whom I'm calling.The app that comes with it is a great way to customize the headphones. Unfortunately, in order to have some features function, Sony requests some of your bio-metric data by asking you to take pictures of your ears, and send the pictures to Sony for analysis. (You do know, don't you, that the ear shapes are as unique as your fingerprints and eye retina?) In this time and age, when every company is trying to track you even in bedroom, and ""Big Brother"" spies on its citizen everywhere, I won't touch those features with a 10-foot pole if the access to these features is conditioned by giving up my privacy. Your mileage may vary.One of the awesome features of these headphones is their capability to fold. Thus, they fit neatly in their dedicated case, and don't take much space; which makes it easy to travel with them. Although Sony released a newer version addressing the sound issue with the wind, I opted to still purchase these because the newer version does not fold.How much do I like them? Much enough to purchase two sets: one for me, and one for my better half.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2023",AGIG3U6I5HUHSGDT2LWJQP5CUHIA,True,33,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

In my opinion after using them for a while now I can say they are the best wireless headphones I've ever used. The sound quality is great, including the bass. They have great battery life typically lasting me 2 or more days of use between 6-8 hours a day. The active noise cancelation is great its kind of spooky at first but it becomes very comforting after you get used to it. The passive noise canceling is good too however you can still hear those around you and other important things if you are using them while out running errands and whatnot. Then there is the pass through/ ambient sound mode which in my opinion is only use full when you have it set up through the app to turn this one when it detects you talking because it makes everything very loud even amplifying sounds you might not hear or notice without them.TLDR: Amazing headphones if I could give more than 5 stars I would.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHCCO3CSLWNTYIR3IOXIVDTSVQCA,True,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

RDLWJ8EVJISYF,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Great 2nd headphones,Jae Lee,4,"To give you some context: I've had 3 ANC/noise cancelling headphones now. The Sony X4s are my third. I started with a $40 pair of Taotronics. These are great for a budget pair of noise cancelling headphones. I moved up to a more expensive pair of Taotronics 90 (~$80). The Sony XM4 is my third and at this junction, I was looking for the following features:1. Better noise cancelling.2. Better comfort, that I would wear longer than an hour).3. Better sound quality (for music and podcast).4. Portability (for traveling).The Sony XM5 just came out so these XM4 were priced at $228. I'm not used to spending this much on headphones but I'm glad I decided to upgraded to these. I was on the fence about the XM5s but the ability to fold the XM4s up, plus the fact that it was priced much less was all the reason I needed to go with the XM4.Things to note about the XM4s:1. ANC - Noise cancelling is great. It covers more of the frequencies than my previous cheap pairs did.2. Ambient Sound - Ambient noise is pretty bad. When you turn noise cancelling off to talk to someone or to hear the outside world, the sound is hollow. If you want ANC headphones where ambient sound comes through clear, these XM4s are not the best. They have the feature but it's not great. Personally, I just take my headphones off when I need to talk to someone. Otherwise, I only wear these with noise cancelling on.3. Comfort - The XM4s are very comfortable. I can easily wear these for 2 hours+ without any discomfort. I've slept in these too (to help me sleep). The ear cushions are soft and pliable enough where I don't feel any pain points. As other reviewers have mentioned, because it does such a good job with noise cancelling, there will be heat that builds up inside, especially if you're exerting energy or wearing these on a wam/hot day. It's not unbearable; just something to note.4. Sound Quality - Sony has an equalizer you can mess with and it helps to fine tune the how music or speech (ie., podcasts) comes through but it's not as good as some of the higher end headphones. But again, for $228, these headphones are a good deal, especially compared to others in the same class.Note: There are other features like the auto-pause, touch navigation (ie., play/pause/next/prev, and volume), and the hand-over-ear to turn ambient noise on... These work fine for me. I like how it works but I don't consider these as PROs or CONs... They're just different and may be useful based on personal preference.Summary: I would highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones at the current price of ~$228. If you want comfort, portability, slightly better sound quality than other comparable/competing brands, this is a very good choice. If you're coming from cheaper-type headphones, these are a great upgrade. If you're on the fence between a much more expensive pair of headphones AND need a pair of affordable headphones straight away, these are a great option. I will likely purchase another in my lifetime but these will work for me for years to come until one that has better sound quality for music and speech becomes affordable [for me].","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AFYCJRL6M67IX6WUPQGN3JQO5ASA,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

RODXFEQLR1YSO,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best comfort fit for small heads. The hype for noise cancellation is real!,Sarah,4,"I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2022",AGIYWPZ2FJWADZSWTIUZ5OQLRSHQ,True,7,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R3TUSBANMTQS7N,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars All Inclusive and Fully Delivering,Julian Sanchez,5,"These headphones work perfectly for everything I need them for, be it gaming, work conferencing, or listening to music. The sound quality and customizability is best when used on a phone in conjunction with the app, but it works just fine everywhere else too. I've never received a complaint while on a call with them.I personally listen to plenty of EDM and bass heavy music, and I gotta say that these headphones deliver like none other I've owned. The app again is the most useful in this aspect, allowing full EQ customizing and direct control over the bass quality. Here the noise cancelation can also be set or modes can be set for the adaptive noise cancelation.When the headphones drop the ball a little is when you use a different device which doesn't support the app. At this point they'll default to whatever your last settings were on the app in terms of noise cancelation, EQ, and volume. If you really want to work around this however it's a simple task to pair your phone as the secondary device to the headphones and control them from there while listening to your primary. The auto switch between multiple paired devices depending on audio input is also great, being able to do this fluently was a big factor for me when shopping. Pairing across multiple devices is really easy after the first time paired, most times automatic.The final positive point I'll address is the touch controls on the right ear cup. I've seen many listing this as a fail point for these headphones, and I was hesitant about it at first too due to my previous headphones employing physical buttons. However, I've had no issue with the touch controls and actually find them quite convenient. They're not as sensitive as I've seen some claim, maybe they fixed this in a software patch. I've worn these under a hoodie without triggering the controls.I've been using these almost daily for the past 2 months and I've really only come across two troublesome points. The first is that paradoxically despite having multiple microphones which work during wireless use for calls, when you plug the included aux cable into your device for wired use, the headphones only provide audio and on a call use the connected device's microphone. This was very inconvenient for me as I tried to use the headset in a wired format for game chatting and was held back by the lack of a microphone on the remote, an issue I didn't have with my previous headset. When attempting to make a wired call with my phone in my pocket this became an issue as well for obvious reasons, which is when I first noticed this design.The second issue I've had is one of comfort. Now don't get me wrong these headphones are comfortable and I wear them for multiple hours at a time, but sometimes my left ear enters in discomfort after these extended periods due to the inner design of the left ear cup. As advertised the headphones detect when you take them off and stop playback accordingly, but to accomplish this they use a rather large sensor in the interior of the left ear cup. This sensor ends up pressing against the tip of my ear and becomes annoying after some time, but its not usually an issue and thus not a big enough problem to stop me from wearing them daily for hour long sessions.All in all I fully recommend these headphones as long as the two issues noted above aren't a deal breaker for you. They've served me well and I've felt like I've gotten value for my money.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2021",AHJFFVMMENIBY5VX736WVMJZCHBA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

My bedroom contains the entrance to the underworld so it's usually around 81F/27C even with the A/C cranked. Because of this I have a rather loud tower fan right next to my computer desk. When I first power on these headphones I actually checked the fan to make sure it was still running. The headphones cut out the sound completely! As for the playback volume, maximum is either loud enough or too loud, depending on your age.

RIUMOOIYC2JV8,B09LYF2ST7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful headphones, ESPECIALLY for the price!",Sarah,5,"These headphones are great! I've had them for a little over a month now, and they performed better than I expected!FUNCTIONS: For $20 bucks you can't really beat these. Once you connect it to a device via bluetooth, it will remember those devices and automatically connect to them anytime you turn on the headphones (I believe this only works for up to 2 devices). For example, if I'm working on my iPad and also have my iPhone with me, when I turn on the headphones it will automatically start playing the audio of whichever device I'm currently on (as long as they're connected to the headphones via bluetooth). If I'm listening to a video on my iPad with the headphones, then pause the video and go on my iPhone to watch a different video, I don't have to switch anything on the headphones!!! They'll just automatically switch over to the phone's audio (I believe this function only works for up to 2 devices, because I find that if I'm working on my iPhone+iPad+Macbook, I have to disconnect from one of the two currently connected devices in order to connect to the third device's audio). I'm also able to take phone calls through the headphones since it has a built-in microphone. Honestly for $20 bucks, I did NOT expect this level of functionality!!! Haha.FIT: I haven't faced any issues with the fit of the headphones, they've been quite comfortable for long-term wear. They're very lightweight which is wonderful when trying to avoid fatigue and pain. They're snug but not too tight, and they also have an adjustable strap so you can lengthen them to fit over your ears as needed. I personally try not to be too rough with them since I know $20 can only go so far, and I have seen other reviews of people who faced issues with the quality of the ear padding and such, so my advice would be to just be as gentle as possible with the headphones when taking them on/off or adjusting. I personally don't workout with them and primarily use them in a home/office setting, so I can't speak on the quality once sweat or rapid movements/motion comes into play, which I know for some people would be an important factor to consider!SOUND: Again, for $20 bucks this can't be beat haha. The sound clarity/quality is great, and much better than I expected for the price. You can also change the equalizer with the click of a button which is really nice (it has a certain number of options, I can't remember how many). I would NOT call these headphones completely soundproof or noise cancelling, because you are still able to hear quite a bit of environmental sound, unless you're blasting the volume... which I wouldn't recommend haha. The headphones do drown out a lot of environmental noise, but again, NOT necessarily soundproof/noise cancelling in comparison to other higher priced headphones. Another important thing to note: whatever you're listening to can most likely be heard a bit by people around you. Unfortunately these headphones DON'T isolate the audio very well (unless the volume is very low)...so if you're in a quiet library around others or a place that requires silence, this could likely be an issue!I hope this review was helpful! Overall, these are definitely GREAT headphones for the price!!!","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AFD3HS44VSHQPQ3AY46AD7MNZDKA,True,61,Color: Black
R32EE9YQZHPX15,B09LYF2ST7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Value,Debbie Landon,5,"I would consider myself a professional headphonist and these are a steal for under $20. The quality is superb and are extremely light so you don’t even realize you’re wearing them sometimes. They fit the whole ear completely without any pressure on any part of the outer ear and envelope a perfect seal so there’s no need for ANC. Rock EQ setting is best for music listening, but the default Pop setting is good for all types of listening. I wanted to use used these for a full week before reviewing them and they’ve miraculously made it all week on the same initial charge to full when I got them. I also like that it mixes the notifications like “battery low” instead of completely muting the content for such playback. I’ve used them throughout the days connected multipoint to my cell and Windows 10 laptop, being able to make Teams calls at work and listen to podcast and video content after work. One criticism is the Teams app must use the headset-mode setting to work and after a call it takes about 15-20 seconds for the computer to switch back and be able to play headphone-mode content, however playback to the other multipoint-connected device is always instantaneous. Another downside is the +/- buttons should be volume for single momentary press instead of track advance/previous instead of long press, and the swing-out for the earcups are also backwards from what they usually are (usually swing to the rear than to the front). One last downside is if one of the multipoint devices wanders out of range, it does not automatically connect once it comes back into range and must be reconnected manually. Other than that, the sound is very good, the headphones are very comfortable, and I was astonished by the battery life for a set of headphones this feature-rich at this price point. I would highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AGHX2M2UHZXCJCWMSS66RICVSZMA,True,107,Color: Black

The long battery life was really critical to me, and a friend recommended this product for me after they learned I'd been interested in getting a bluetooth headphone.This is actually the second one I purchased, as the first one I bought had a driver issue that corrupted the audio output on Windows 11 computers. It worked fine connecting to phones and to Windows 10 computers, so I'm not sure what caused the issue, but getting a new one thankfully showcased it was a bug in the device since my new one works well.I am running into a strange issue where sometimes the audio on computer will get muffled when I open other programs. The only one for sure I know causes this is when I open OBS, which is annoying but I imagine there's a solution to this problem. I just haven't seeked out a fix yet.But if you're looking for a product with incredibly battery life, great comfort, and decent audio output, this is a really nice headphone, especially for the price.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2024",AHWBWBKWRKAGV7CQJF2NDFTHQWIA,True,41,Color: Green
RLT0T5ZDL0545,B09LYF2ST7,5.0 out of 5 stars TLDR: Wow,Amazon Customer,5,"The media could not be loaded. Not much of a review writer, but I spent days agonizing over buying these vs something more expensive. Hopefully this will help someone stress less 👍TLDR: Just try them. Get them as a gift even! These are far past anyone’s expectations of $20 head huggers!!!Now… (for longevity, just know I’ve had these since mid December and use them daily)————————————These are so great… hands down. They aren’t gonna blow you away as they are only $20-23’s, but I also have SkullCandy Crushers evo, Apple AirPod pro 2s, and random other wired buds and THESE are by far my favorite.Pros:-1 I can wear these 24/7. They are feather light; not in a cheaply-made way, but in a very intentional way. I can actually FORGET I have these on. Really. The AirPods hurt after several hours or even start to slide out. My Crushers literally hurt just to put them on and I have a tiny head! But THESE!!! They are such a joy to wear!!!-2 The Bluetooth connection just WORKS! I cannot understand how THESE headphones accomplish this when Apple and SC cannot!Apple pairs fine, but then randomly starts playing sound from another device all the time. Messing with settings is irritating and still it just starts playing audio from random iOS drives in the house! On the other hand, the Crushers have to be cleared in order to connect to a new device. Every time. I almost sent them back cause I assumed they were broke, but no. Apple struggles with it and you have to “forget the device” every single time you want to say, go from your phone to an iPad (then back again). It’s madness. Some big brain thought this was a good idea.. These $20 ones; you power them on and BAM it connects and STAYS connected! If it doesn’t automatically connect, I just tap the name and it’s instant. 🤯-3 The mic is fantastic. I’ve only used it in my home, but ppl tell me it’s crystal clear.-4 The easy eq on the side! No apps to download etc. just push it and it cycles through predetermined settings. And these settings actually make a diff. If you want to listen to an instrumental track, don’t leave it in “bass” setting cause you will automatically think it’s the headphones and they are garbage. NO! Shame on you for blaming them lol-5 I’m not sure how to describe it as I’m not knowledgeable in audio devices (audiophile?), but what I also love about these is the spacial depth of sound. Some music just has the ability to surround you with these things in a way no other devices does. Even the AirPods with “spacial audio” can’t seem to replicate these “vast” atmospheric sounds at times. Of course this also relies heavily on the audio, but wow.-6 They fold so well. At first you might think, these things are flipping around everywhere and going to break.. nope. They just effortlessly fold in on themselves. I am rough on headphones too as a busy mom. They get tossed in my giant mom-backpack daily with no case or cover, squished between iPads etc and they are holding up like a champ!-7 I clean house in them for hours in the day and make/take calls as well. Not once have I received a low battery warning. They also have USB-C!!!!! For $20 I wouldn’t have expected that, and they charge incredibly fast.-8 The price. Omg the price lol I just spent more than $20 at McDonald’s.-9 They come packaged SO nice. It’s no iOS unboxing experience, but ordering anything online has me jaded lately. I fully expected these to just be in a plain box with some Chinese wording, with lots of bubble wrap, but no. It comes in a simple, well made, cardboard cube, but it has bright colors and a presentation value that’s hard to get online with cheap electronics.-10 the giant L/R on the inside! I never realized how many times I have flipped headphones and ear buds all around to figure out which was left ear and which was right. I never even knew I needed this in my life! It’s just another little detail that they didn’t HAVE to even bother with, but the details on these things seemed to matter to the designer and/or company.CONS:-1 They don’t get loud enough for me. Going from AirPods shooting sound waves into my ear canal and Crushers literally made to rattle from bass, directly to these can be frustrating as I have to just put them on max volume immediately. Is it a drastic volume issue? Absolutely not in my opinion. It’s just the ONE thing for me keeping these from being a god-tier S++++++ rating. Hell, this might even be considered a PRO feature, as I’m sure all my other devices are chipping away at my hearing one day at a time…-2 There IS no second con lol seriously.Conclusion:I have a white pair, bought my husband the black pair and am about to purchase my teen a pair. THAT is how much I love these and why I just HAD to write a literal essay about the brand.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2024",AHEMBQOYIJ5F3HH6C55XYJTBGDQA,True,315,Color: Black

Acetone might work, but I haven't tried that yet - so if this is your plan, proceed with caution.Functionality• The sound is OK; not the worst, not the best.• Sound leaks a lot around 40-50% of maximum volume.

I need to really speak up when I wear them on calls, so I've been switching to my Jabra headset instead. But if you're in a bind, they do work for calls, just make sure to speak loudly and clearly so the mic actually picks up your voice.• As a non-bluetooth user, battery seems OK. I've never had to charge it after the first charge and every time I have wanted to use wireless, they've been charged.• I like really really loud music, and I don't feel like these get up to the volume level I crave - which is probably a good thing, health-wise.• They have fairly good passive noise cancellation, which I didn't know they had before purchasing. Everything seems very muted when I have them on, but not enough I can't hear anything, so this was a nice surprise.Overall, I like them, would recommend them and would purchase again.

The cheapest ones!! because they are just as good for a fraction of the price. (Although I am not a stickler for sound quality )The battery is God tier. I have never run out, I just have moments where I think ‘hey I Haven’t charged these in a while maybe I should plug them in.’ Since I’ve never reached the limit on battery I can’t say for sure, but I would say it’s more than five days. Maybe even 7. The Sony ones lasted less than a day.They are comfortable. They aren’t too tight on my head which I am very sensitive to because of my migraines. If I have a ponytail in for too long I will get a headache so the headphones have to be comfortable or it’s a dealbreaker. I have fallen asleep in these which is absolutely unheard of for me. I think I have a really sensitive head. When I first took them out of the package and put them on I was thinking they weren’t going to work because they felt a little uncomfortable but after I adjusted them andused them for a while I no longer have that issue. I can wear them all day and only have the slightest bit of fatigue on my head. It usually goes away in about five minutes and then I can put the headphones back on. Setting them up with Bluetooth was easy. I’m not an audiophile so the sound may not be up to some standards but it is just fine with me. Use them to listen to music, Netflix, YouTube, podcasts, and to drown out my upstairs neighbors who I think are running a day care bc all I hear all day and night is running back and forth across the apartment. Nonstop. I wish I was exaggeratingThe plastic components don’t feel particularly cheap although they didn’t have that heavy feel of the more expensive ones. But I think that might be a plus for me. Less weight probably equals less fatigueI don’t think you would be disappointed w these unless you’re a musician or need them for work. But for ppl like me they are perfectly fine. More than fine. I paid less than $25 and I don’t think you can beat that for what you’re gettingI hope all these positive reviews dont result in a hike in price.

The metal band is very strong and I feel secure wearing them. These are really comfortable around the ears and the speaker rims are nice and big so they completely wrap around the earlobes instead of resting directly on top of them (which is something I've noticed with other over-ear headphones and can be very uncomfortable wearing after a while). The battery life also lasts a loooooonnng time (I use them for around 8 hours a day, longest I went without charging was a week), so it's perfect to take anywhere. Only thing I don't like as much is the bass quality since the headphones aren't as tight as I'd like them to be, so it sounds farther away. This can be easily fixed with some settings and an equalizer to increase the bass though if you have a smaller head shape like mine. It pairs well with all my devices except for my Mac (doesn't appear in settings), but it can still be connected with an earphone jack if you have a similar problem.

Bottom line, she is very happy with these BERIBES Bluetooth Headphones as they meet her needs. I'm a little more fussy with Sound Quality being first on my list. If you want solid DEEP Bass with crisp clear highs and lots of overall punch, the BERIBES Bluetooth Headphones might not be for you.

(I’ve tested it around my family 😅) You can change the mode in which the audio focuses on, like if a song has more bass or vocals to it, and I’ve gotta say I really like that feature.

R2DV19SUJ3ZQS1,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for the price...,Thomas Glebe,5,"Stereo headphones have come a long way over several decades, and there have been so many advances, it's often hard to keep up with the latest technologies. In the beginning, there was basically only ONE type, that of being, the completely over the ear, studio-type and others. As things progressed, ""earbuds"" of many types began to be offered and an expensive type of these have emerged, with the advent of the I-Pod and various other portable CD and MP3 players. I've never really liked these, as no matter how much one spends, they still have to snugly and comfortably fit the individual's ears, which is no small task, as all human ears are not created equal. Fortunately, various forms of the original concept of over-ear, noise-canceling headphones have kept pace with the earbud variety. Some of these are more completely over the ear than others, some are more or less outside noise-canceling types, and then there are the cheapest non-earbud types, which can vary greatly in concept and overall quality.For the best experience in private listening, one needs to spend at least $50 these days, if not upwards of $100 or more. However, these type of stereo headphones are usually very large and are not really suited to portable, on the go listening. Still, they do not suffer from the earache of buds, and usually produce the best overall, robust sound. In between most earbud types and most larger ""monitor"" types, there are so many varieties nowadays, that the general, plug-in stereo-headphones shopper is usually left quite confused when trying to pick out a suitable, high-quality model, at a reasonable price. For almost all purposes, this is a really good buy, and I give them high marks in just about every headphone category one can think of or desire. And the asking price is a bargain.One little caveat however. The Amazon ""product description"" and even mentioned in a review or two, state that the cord length is nearly 10 feet. I think this must be referring to some earlier model or just a mistake, because the cord length of these is only about 6 feet total. While this does not interfere with my personal use or intentions of use before I even bought a pair, sound unheard, I think this should be pointed out. The difference between a 10-foot cord length and a 6 foot one is rather substantial. Therefore, these are in no way suitable for ""roaming the room"" or dancing ""to your heart's content,"" as the Amazon product description states. Amazon should correct this product description. If one desires more than a six-foot cord length however, a cheap extension can always be purchased for a few bucks at Radio Shack and the like. It's a 6 foot cord though, not 10.Outside of this however, these are really great headphones for the price, and offer terrific sound and value. While they are ""fold-able"" in a way, this only applies somewhat, as they are not completely so, and attempts at making the set truly small for carrying purposes might only break them. While they are ""over-the-ear,"" they are not entirely of the more expensive, truly ""noise-canceling"" variety, though they do a fair job at this, again, for the price. The earphones are padded and the set is nicely adjustable for nearly all head sizes, unless you have the head size of a mouse or Eraserhead. Extended use is no problem, once you easily adjust them to comfortably fit personally. That is, wearing these for hours will not cause any real head/ear strains or pains, either during use or afterwards, volume levels and adjustments aside.These tend to lean heavily towards the bass frequencies and are enhanced to do so, although the mid-range and upper-ranges come through very good as well. Still, since there is no equalizer function, it helps that whatever source you will be listening to with these, can be adjusted itself. That is, if you are using these to listen to a CD or MP3 player, it helps that you are able to use an equalizer at the source, since again, the bass response here is emphasized. I use these mainly for the computer, and my CD/MP3 player on that is fully adjustable as far as regulating highs, mids, and lows, so the extra bass is no problem. Still, even if one is not able to adjust low and mid and high end frequencies on your player source, the overall sound is excellent on generally all forms of music and sounds, and the stereo separation between left and right is, well, right on.I have always had a generally good experience with Panasonic products, and that includes higher-end, higher priced headphones from them. While these are rather cheaply made and fragile, if you take care of them and don't ask them to do what they are clearly not intended to do, you will be pleasantly surprised. A definite bonus is the small volume control on the cord. This comes in real handy at times, since not all music is recorded and produced at the same volume level, and this control allows one to raise or lower the volume without touching the source player. And again, while these headphones are not really suited for any long life with heavy abuse, and might seem too ""cheaply"" made for some, taking care during use negates any such negatives and I would guess these will last and perform well just about as long as you want them to.I bought two pair of these, which got me free shipping, and I really can't complain. They are great for plugging into one's computer, or using with any CD/MP3 player with an equalizer, but generally, they perform well for just about any purpose as far as headphones go. They also fit nicely and comfortably as a ""necklace"" during breaks in listening. One can easily buy much better headphones, but for the price, these offer remarkable sound at an easily affordable price, and I recommend them highly.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2009",AG57W6SE26BZPR5NS7OCGFEET3EQ,True,295,Style: On Ear - With Volume Control

I don't use them all the time, but I have used them regularly throughout the years. The spongy stuff on the ear piece finally just disintegrated.These are a little different than the set I was replacing, but same brand and overall concept. The sound quality is great. They are not noise cancelling, so if that's what you are looking for, these aren't the right headphones for you. If you just want basic headphones, these are great and very cost efficient. And, again, they last FOREVER.Very pleased! I was worried when my old reliables suddenly quit on me. I'm jazzed that I was able to replace them this easily!

R25JYEOK3T4X34,B075LT8YLR,4.0 out of 5 stars Panamazing!,WeStayOldSchool,4,"Ok so before I start my well-detailed review on this product, let me first state I am NOT getting paid for doing this review, NEITHER do I work for Panasonic, I'm doing this purely out of enjoyment and to help anyone else interested in buying this product, as I'm just a teenager into music and quality headphones. Let's go into we look for into a pair of headphones:- Sound Delivery- Bass- Quality of crisp, and clear sound- Convenience- Comfort- Durability- Size- Look/DesignNote: I'll also be comparing this product to my Replica Beats By Dre Minis, ($10) and my Sony MDRZX-100 Heaphones (Paid about $14, now going for $15-$16). Also, I'll be grading this product on the factors of comparison to my other headphones and price.Sound Delivery aka loudness of the sound: Beat my beats. However, these may be right at, or slightly less loud than my sonys. Grade: 8.5/10Bass: Dominated my beats. sonys and these were a bit harder, but although these barely sounded less loud than the sonys, it knocked out the competition in bass, very surprised! Grade: 10/10Quality of sound: It blew the beats completly out the water! Sony and these were very close, until I realized the difference finally doing both sound and bass hip hop songs as test demos. Once again, the panasonic headphones are victorious! This was much of a unexpected surprise of delivery to me too, as of the price, and how the sound of these are not muddy at all like my rep beats, and ridiculously clear and crisp output noise. Grade: 11/10Convenience: Although I didn't go to a gym, i ran in place and shook my head around pretty hard while listening to music, no volume change, nor did they come off at all, as I actually thought they would. Can be used as gym headphones, and are surprisingly, more lightweight than imagined. Weighs less than all headphones, possibly 1/3 almost 1/4 the weight of my sonys! Can use at school, road trips, or exercise as i confidently feel as well, moisture and sweat won't be a factor in them coming off ears while working out since they are made out of foam on the ear cups.Won't weigh down neck or hands at all, even for the fatigue or elderly/crippled. Can extend like my other two pairs of headphones although, can't fold up like rep beats not a big deal however, didn't really expect them to be able to fold. Grade: 10/10Comfort: Probably the lowest grade I'm going to give for these headphones. Unfortunately the foam is a bit rough and irritates my ears and itches after about five minutes, no allergic reactions or side effects though, so don't worry. It is forgivable due to its portability, but not ascomportable as sonys nor my rep beats, although they won't make your ears sore like my rep beats while using. Doesn't feel like pins and needles, though. Grade: 5/10Durability: Another and final flaw to this product, that makes these so inexpensive. Keep in mind I just received mine today, and MAY do an update in maybe a month or two, but it lacks durability I can tell. Although on the outside it seems like solid plastic, the inside you see otherwise, if you flick or mess with it a little. If you drop it in your house, shouldn't be a biggie, although outside on cement may scuff, scratch, or probably break your headphones varying on how hard and stepping on the cord and to what momentum they fling or collide with the ground at. Would not throw them at the ground (obviously), or trust little kids with them really. Keep in mind, if you keep the delicateness, be careful, and take good care of them to mind, this shouldn't be a factor to take into place when purchasing. If your reckless with objects, I do not recommend. Grade: 4/10Size: Although not you average size headphones, I mentioned you are buying this headphones for the light size, plus I favor the small size compared to my others. Grade: 10/10Look: I was debating, If I should include this to my total star grade and overall grade, but I decided no and this is just an extra detail. They are not fancy nor colorful like beats by dre, DJ headphones, sonys, or some of other headphones/earphones. however, you are aware from pictures of the color and what they look like, so I realized that people know what they look like, as well it's not about if they look as cool as beats or not, it's mainly bang for buck. Nice normal oval design on ear cups though as they could be square and wacky like other headphones. Grade: 7/10Overall I'd recommend these to anyone looking for amazing headphones that are inexpensive. Overall grade I'd give these is an 84 percent or a B. For their price though, overall I'd give them 105 percent or an A+. Would suggest the quality comparable to some high end $25 headphones, and would pay for them at a store as high as $29.99 and tax, if they were just a bit more durable and comfortable. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing these, to anyone looking for really good bass and sound delivery headphones that takes decent care of their stuff.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2016",AEJG5K5MUQ4DU7LWBH4TLX573EKA,True,113,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R3AC7OZ68GHHOL,B075LT8YLR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight, inexpensive, voice-only fidelity",Glenn Smollinger,3,"""I recommend this headset for applications where you want to replace earbuds or plugs with a loose fitting hear-through headset that won’t promote ear canal infections."" This was my initial review.I can add a few comments to those. They still do not promote ear-canal infections, so good. They are very lightweight, also good. Inexpensive, obviously good. Fidelity is voice-only. They are good for listening to podcasts. Music reproduction is poor-to-mediocre, with a tinny mid-range, little bass, and strident last octave. It also sounds outright distorted, which is strange, coming from a headphone.Construction: The plastic headband is surprisingly robust, given that I have laid on it with my head and not broken it. The cheap little foam pads will fail first, based on experience. The cord is annoying. It comes off the bottom of the phones, and is joined below the neck. This is a recipe for tangles, and I am very careful to avoid twisting it. The right-angle plug is essentially a hook, and snags on everything, and has to always be rotated when plugged-in so the cord is pointing in the right direction. Panasonic- change this to a straight plug.Usage: I often use them while laying in bed, and the ear plugs were better for that except for the ear-canal infections. The phones are too thick to allow me to lay on my side. I will have to look for thinner phones.","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2023",AGILDR3YBATOVZOFV3HUNFAUX5NA,True,10,Style: On Ear - No Mic

I use them mostly for listening to podcasts on my daily walk. Noise cancelling doesn't really seem to exist so if there's a lot of nearby traffic I have to raise the volume significantly in order to hear anything. And the full audio range isn't *that* full so listening to music isn't stellar, but not bad, either.A major pet peeve, though, and something not restricted to these headphones but that applies to all products these days: when did it become a design thing to put black controls with black labels on black backgrounds? Not very user friendly for people with old tired eyes. Not me, of course, I'm just sayin'. The Left and Right label on each earpiece is just that: black on black (as in the picture, if you can see it).

I chose the Panasonic set because the reviews were favorable and there was no buyers remorse. After approximately 3 weeks of use I can make a general assessment. The sound quality is very good. What I have noticed is that in listening to music this set of headphones showcases various aspects of the sound quality. This is particularly identifiable in the mid-range areas. It does not have the window rattling over powering bass that some may prefer. By having a heavy emphasis on bass the sensitive listener will not hear the softer sounds of flutes or light percussion that the Panasonic headphones can do.

I won't be returning them, but I would not buy again at any price.The Good1. They are cheap2. I like the way they fit over my head in that they are comfortable and do not leave a big gap between the band and my head, as other headphones I have do, which makes them visually better on camera than some alternatives. (I am a live streamer)3. They are actual over ear headphones. Too many headphones marketed as over ear are actually large on ear headphones. These completely go over the ears.This is a decidedly exhaustive list of their merits.The Bad1. Not only do these not cancel noise, they have an odd way of making it worse. I have fans running on my room, and with the headphones on, even if the volume is turned all the way down or I unplug them, something about these headphones is like listening to a sea shell, it's like a sound trap wind tunnel and it is ridiculous.2. Bass is negligible. I suspect these over ear versions are just the on ear versions in different packaging. I've never had over ear headphones sound so crummy before.3. Though they actually go over ear, they do not press firmly against the head, hence the failure to cancel any noise.4. Feels like cheap plastic, I expect them to break. The reason I wanted cheap over ear headphones for this application was because they are intended for my mobile broadcasting kit and the circumstances of travel often destroys equipment. I like to have easily replaced equipment for this purpose, since I don't want to be stressing out about breaking something expensive. I suspect these will break sooner than others.5. The ones I got did not come with a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter and I had to use my own.I bought them as ""Used - Good"" on Amazon, and they arrived with the packaging gone on one and damaged on the other, but the headphones were in visually perfect condition. They function identically which tells me there is nothing unique to these particular units causing this.If you want the cheapest over ear headphones on Amazon, I think these are it. You'll be able to hear the things you want to hear for the most part, as long as you don't need superb quality to be very discriminating.If that's what you want, that is what you will get when you purchase these.If you want anything better than that, don't buy these.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",AEZJYI3WNWFBUKTXHY5HTG5YVVNQ,True,6,Style: Over Ear - No Mic

RIA85YWZ9S2T5,B075LT8YLR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommend! Sound great! They won't last you for ever, but they do outlast other headphones of the price point.",Aaron,4,"These sound great. They're indeed very light weight. They have a gentle fit so don't hurt your ears squeezing them against the sides of your head etc. They're a lot like the old time Sony Walkman style headphones that came with those little cassette players.They're probably fairly durable, but I wear these for hours every single day. I buy 3 or so at a time and unbox the next one when I finish the one I'm wearing off. The quickest I've ever finished one off was around 3 weeks, but they usually last 4 months or so.The bass is there, but not overpowering. It's just right, not too much mid, and not too much high. I'm blind so my computer is talking to me constantly when I'm using it. I'm also profoundly deaf, so wear behind the ear hearing aids. These fit well against the aids if I turn them around backward. The downside to that is the stereo field is reversed. The flat pads on these don't try to wrap around your ear or cancel out environmental sound. They are very gentle in terms of causing hearing aids to experience feedback. I can wear them for many hours without getting tired of having them on. They don't press the backs of my ear against the aid and produce sore spots and the like.The cable is not overly thick, not ridiculously thin either - probably just about right for the price. The plug is an l shaped, sticks out of your device about 1 cm before the 90 degree turn, then the sleeve ends 7/8th of an inch. The wire splits about 14 inches from the earphones with a little plastic gizmo that does not slide up or down. It sends one wire to each earphone.The earphones are on a slide thing that's in the headband, you can slide them out for a bigger head. I always keep them all the way slid in, that's the best fit for my hearing aids. All the way slid in, worn backward with the headband tilted way forward and nearly on my forehead. If it sounds weird it's because it is, but it works, and works for many hours every day.If I want to complain, it would be that I kind of wish they had a straight plug, with a short jacket on it, and I wish they had an integrated decent quality microphone. I've driven myself crazy trying to find a headset that looks sort of like these do, has flat pads, sounds ok, will sit on my hearing aids, etc, etc, while having a microphone that, a: doesn't have a short and allow the person on the other end to hear my computer talking as though it's actually their computer talking, even though I'm freaking wearing headphones, and b: refuse to sound decent.The most common failure point for these have been one or the other of the earphones will become quieter. Once or twice one will completely stop working and I can affect it by pushing the cord up into the bottom of that earphone, but usually it just grows quieter. This is most often after a few hundred hours of usage though, and I'm not disappointed. For the price, I honestly don't think these can be beat in terms of durability and sound quality. They're above average any way I slice it for sound quality. They won't hold up against Bowse and the like but they're quite impressive anyhow.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2017",AFMM6RGMYSPYN5FJNYGWX5ENM5VA,True,14,Style: On Ear - No Mic

Finney,5,"If you want value for your money, if you lose your headphones too often, if you wear out the cord, or plug on your headphones, these are the ones to get. I have a couple of MP3 players I use at work daily and with them I wear my headphones constantly. I either lose or wear them out whether they are more expensive or cheaper. I was absolutely startled at the bass that came our of these phones. It is deep, rich and accurate. Overall sound is better than a pair I once had that cost me about 10 times as much. Knowing that I would either wear them out or lose them I bought 4 pairs this time. I will definitely buy more when the need arises. An excellent deal, I highly recommend these phones.****UPDATE 9 July 2016*****After 10 years my opinion of these headphones hasn't done anything but get better. I just wore out a pair that I've been using for at least 2 or 3 years, so it's time to buy some more. Still the best bang for your buck. I still give a pair away from time to time, and my original recommendation stands. Great Phones! It is the 14th of October 2019, and I just took out a fresh pair of these headphones for a trip to Idaho. The old ones, probably a year or so old, are still functioning. I'm still thunderstruck at the overall quality of sound from the HT-21s. The base is amazing, and accurate. My ears need as much treble as possible which these do deliver. After 13 years since this review was originally published, I still haven't found anything better. At the current price, give them a try. It's not like you'd be out for much more than the price of a breakfast at McDonalds.Last update December 15, 2023It's been about 18 years, or more since I bought my first pair of these headphones. I dont use them as much since I'm now retired, but my opinion hasn't changed. I still haven't found headphone that offer as much value based upon amazing sound for a very low price. I have 2 spare pairs put away should I need to replace the pair that's out for use.

But for me they do what I need them to doEach pair has lasted me between 6-12 months, depending on how many times I accidentally yank the cord--they really hold up to a LOT of abuse, the wires inside not breaking for ages and ages. The spongy ear covers stay on! That is a huge plus. But they can be removed for cleaning, and I've kept them from all my old pairs, so I have backup if I want to take them off and clean one set. They' rea not extremely fluffy or cushioning, but they do the job.The end of the cord is an elbow. The over-the-top part is adjustable, and I don't have a problem with them readjusting/sliding on their own.I only listen to text-to-speech or audio books and, as long as the speakers don't go in and out (as all headphones do when the cords get broken inside) I am happy. I use these to listen to books overnight. I need something that just plugs into my Victor Reader Stream and does nothing else. Since I wear these all night long, 365 days a year, a predominant side-sleeper, the way they fit onto my head needs to be flat enough that they don't bother my ears or head, and in all the years I've been using these they only have a handful of times, when I've REALLY fallen hard asleep (we're talking drool, pillow face creases, the whole deal). I also wear a CPAP, and these don't interfere with that headgear.The only con for me is that they've changed the cord to being a sort of rubbery material instead of the older ""slippery"" one, so it sticks a bit instead of the smooth glide they've had all the previous years. That makes it harder to pull them out form under me when I flip over. I miss that slippery cord a LOT.If they are the same style and quality as the last 5 times I've bought them then I'll be just as happy this 6th time.","Reviewed in the United States April 19, 2021",AGU4DKNRT2HPLYHGT3GV522HSJBQ,True,1,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R2XBHJ0SU75ZLI,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars These sound great. A deal at thrice the price.,N. Bell and K. Johnson,5,"Forget for a minute that these are under 7 bucks.I purchased these headphones primarily because I needed some cheap cans that would allow me to play video games and still hear what is going on around me in the real world. Xbox One now supports Windows Sonic, a surround-soundifier for headphones, and I wanted to take advantage of that. Figured these would be less isolating than my earbuds or over-ear Skullcandys, and the price was right. I didn't have much expectation beyond that.TLDR version: These sound way better than I expected.It has been a few years since I had a heaphone of this design, a lower-end ""came with your '90s Walkman or CD portable"" on-ear type. Both the very best and very worst I've owned were made by Sony, and if my aural memory serves, these are much closer to the good ones. Bass is not super-powerful but there's certainly enough low-end thump to make video games sound satisfying. From guns and explosions in Wolfenstein II, to thunder and horse-hoof beats in Oblivion, these are more than adequately bassy for a sense of realism. I can listen thru these quite happily without wishing for my larger and bassier Skullcandys. Upper-bass and lower mids are smooth and warm, never honky. Upper-mids and treble are airy, if a teensy bit over-emphasized. I don't mind that, as it makes dialogue and quiet passages in music easier to hear at low volume.I've been mostly listening to electronic chill and ambient thru these, with a few classical tunes here-and-there. No complaints. Bass is, again, not mind-blowing, but just enough for low strings, low brass, drums, and various electronic bloops and bleeps. Stereo imaging is great, seeming to extend well beyond the boundaries of my head. I think this helps the illusion of 5.1 surround when listening to Windows Sonic. Rain in the game Oblivion sounds like it's really falling all around me, and the voices of various characters walking around the game all come from distinct points in space. Shows like Stargate Universe on DVD and Battlestar Galactica on Amazon Prime sound similarly spectacular. I would say the sense of surrounding space is more realistic with these than with my earbuds, and the fact that I can still hear my loved ones around me while listening is a great bonus.I can't find too much fault with these. Hard rock and hip-hop might sound a bit thin and screechy through these headphones, especially when cranked to eleven. The plug might be too fat to fit through some phone cases, so use an extender or remove your case for portable listening. Build quality is not phenomenal, but as long as you're not stuffing them in a backpack or gym bag, and treating them like a grown adult should, they will last quite a while.These would be great to wear while walking around a park, while shopping, or anywhere else where you want your tunes with you but still want to hear what's going on in the real world.Ok, now we can talk about the price.

R1RZWZD907X416,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for the price! Wires need strain relief at the speakers. Foam cushions not needed.,DarthRad,5,"I've been using these headphones for about a decade or more now.The first one I had broke fairly quickly, because the headphone has a fundamental design flaw with its very thin and delicate wires and no strain relief where the wires enter the speakers (the 3.5mm plug side does have strain relief between the wire and the plug, if you are wondering what that term means and looks like). So what breaks these headphones is that any movement causes these wires to get yanked and torqued around this pivot/anchor point where they enter the speakers, and that's where they break inside the insulation.So with the next several of the headphones I bought, I decided to add my own strain relief to these wires, by applying glue to this juncture. The best type of glue to use is one with some elasticity, like shoe goop or E6000, as they are now marketing it. PVC pipe cement (or model airplane cement) also works, but once this glue get old and hardened, the constant torquing will cause the glue joint to crack at the joint. But PVC glue does work and I have a lot of PVC cement around and it is easy to apply and re-apply.The second problem with these headphones is that the foam cushions have no anti-oxidation resistance and quickly turn into dust after a couple or years or so of exposure to ordinary air. Apparently, according to the Customer Q&A answers, there are generic 2"" replacement foam cushions available that will fit. However, these headphones don't really need replacement cushions since you're probably not listening to audiophile quality music with them anyway and they work fine without any foam cushions at all.Finally, these used to be cheaper, going for about six dollars, but have now gone up in price like with everything else. I'm in the process of rejuvenating the anchor points of several of these headphones at the moment with more glue, and may get some more of these before they go up more in price.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2022",AFDWEBB3AFU3X5QNJ73EUKJOGILQ,True,7,Style: On Ear - No Mic

Like any piece of electronic equipment with thin wires you can't treat it roughly and not pull it from a device using the wires only or yank it around in any way considering the connection points are not reinforced. Certainly considering the price the sound is decent. I played in a dance band and had a short stint in a studio, so I have at least a vague idea as to how a speaker should or can sound considering pricing. You want to bitch, get a Bose or one of the other high-end units. If I accidentally break it, I'm not going to cry about it, I'll just get another one. I can understand being pissed if it doesn't work out of the box (so to speak), but send it back and get another one. This does happen when you are making hundreds of thousands of units. Some individuals are so spoiled. There are no bells and whistles, but it works. And anyone that expects an inexpensive on-ear to be noise cancelling while having extraordinary frequency range in a single speaker needs a saliva test. I had one 4 times as expensive and the sound was about the same. Sometimes cheap ain't all that bad. If you are an ""audiophile,"" maybe an over-the-ear like a Bose may be right for you, but I have found them heavy, bulky, hot, ill-fitting and generally uncomfortable. I haven't found one yet that was comfortable. Yes, hooking these up to a high-end audio system would be a waste but for a computer or gym these are fine.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2022",AGUHES2MPOTR7VZB7WAXGAEWHVAA,True,10,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R263MS9TX0BU7J,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Listen to music while out walking,Amazon Customer,5,"I got these headphones to listen to music when I'm out walking. These headphones are lightweight (i.e. easy to carry around while walking), have ""good enough"" sound quality, and were also reasonably cheap to purchase. While I own headphones that have better sound quality, those other headphones are a lot heavier and also were more costly to buy originally. I also own some ""Bluetooth"" (wireless) headphones (whereas these require a headphone jack on your music player), but again those other headphones weigh more and were more costly to purchase.NOTE: These are just headphones, so you do need to supply your own ""music player"" to use with them. I'm personally using my Android smartphone as my portable ""music player"". Yes, the phone is slightly heavier than a standalone MP3 player, but I already carry around my phone when away from the house (so why add a standalone music player I also have to carry?). And with the micro SD card I've put in the phone, I was able to easily store my whole MP3 collection locally on the phone (effectively giving me a HUGE jukebox of music I carry around with me). And, as an added bonus, I also have any other handy phone apps/features whenever I need them. For example, I have a Pedometer app on the phone that automatically records how much I'm walking. And you never know when you might want a digital camera, when you might need GPS mapping software, or have the need to make/receive a phone call (all of which, and more, my phone can handle for me).","Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2023",AFBMX435SBORHDW5RSPM2HTTRYHA,True,11,Style: On Ear - No Mic
R272E7B90FDC3M,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars These things ROCK!!!,P. Killion,5,"So I've recently received my Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones, and I've gotta say, I'm impressed! Cheap headphones have come a long way, but these really do take the cake. I've had dozens of headphones in my life, and working in the video production field, I've used some really pricey ones (don't get me wrong, there's a big difference between this type of headphone and high-quality monitor headphones).These are the perfect music/leisure headphones. They have great sound, but the surprising part is how much bass these things put out! It's like having a sub right next to your ear! However, I will point out, these things do put out a little too much bass to be accurate right off the bat, but an EQ can fix that if you prefer a more ""harmonious"" sound; if you like your bass, then you won't have to do a thing. The overall sound output is pretty decent: lows, mids, highs, they're all there. Now, these are cheap so accuracy is a different story (these are slightly muddy compared to more expensive headphones), but like I said, these are leisure headphones, which work excellent for listening to rock/pop/rap, etc. Unless you plan on dishing out $40+, you won't find anything better, and those still might not be great for music listening, since you kinda want that accentuated bass/booming tone for most music (or at least I do).So, these are cheap headphones, don't expect them to last forever, but if taken care of, there's nothing mechanically flawed in the pair. This is the old-school defacto design, and it kinda makes me laugh to see we've moved away from this design for buds (which, at least they have improved, but still don't compare). Since these aren't buds or noise canceling, others will be able to hear your music at higher volumes, but it really isn't that bad, since these have ""ports"" I figured it might be louder externally than it actually is.I believe another reviewer pointed this out already, but the title is misleading, the port is merely referring to a literal ""port"" or hole, so that bass can be amplified in the compact design; there aren't like extra plugs or anything wacky on these headphones, just the normal 3.5mm headphones jack. The packaging doesn't even have any mention of the port, which I'm assuming they removed due to confusion; I only knew what XBS was because they used to have it slapped on their products. Also, the cord is 4.5ft in case you wanted to know, I couldn't find that anywhere on Amazon, had to go to another site to find that out; that length is perfect for me, since they are plugged into the front audio jack on a PC sitting on the floor. My previous iPod buds were 3ft and I had to tilt my head to use them.So, all in all, you should buy these. I'm glad I bought them, may buy half a dozen more to be honest, I really enjoy these little headphones!","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2011",AHUDVGTYIZN2IYMKNP6OIDSEBMSQ,True,10,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R2OBR7SCDHZUWK,B075LT8YLR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Headphones, even in the year 2012",Mopen,5,"Who would have thought that my search for the most comfortable pair of headphones would lead me to these? I sure didn't. I have tried, and still own, in ear ""bud"" headphones, behind the neck in-ear headphones, medium cup sized over-ear headphones, and huge over-ear closed style headphones. All have their perks, and unfortunately negatives too. The in-ear type of headphones would actually cause me physical pain only shortly after wearing them. The little ones, buds, with the little suction type end piece hurt the most. And the portable factor was dismissible once I realized I had to fight to untangle them each time I wanted to use them. The around the neck in-ear headphones, but no ""suction cup"", would typically yield better results in regards to the length of time before pain commenced. They still hurt after some time, and because the pressure of the band was suppose keep them on your head they weren't very practical for quickly taking off. This also made having them around your neck uncomfortable. Moving on I then tried headphones with over-ear designs. I ended my search with my Audio-technica monitor headphones (ATH-A700). I love them, for the most part. Audio quality is superb, and the comfort of the band is great, as the wing design fits to your head. They have a closed back design so it helps keep outside noise at a reduced level. These positives unfortunately came with some big negatives though. One, obviously, they are not very portable, and much less practical to use in public. Secondly, due to me spending large amounts of time using headphones for work, school, and hobbies, My neck would start to ache. The sheer weight of the headphones was actually causing pain in my neck around my shoulder area. Keep in mind, I was wearing them for close to 5-8 hours straight, so I'm not knocking the ATH-A700s, I still love them. Now the Panasonic RP-HT21. I was doing my normal shopping on amazon when I decided to throw these headphones into my cart as an add on item. I thought to myself, ""What the heck, why not? Would be nice to have a pair I could throw around, travel with. They have to be super light by the looks of them, which has a bunch of benefits in itself. They look like the headphones I had in the 90s though, so there's a chance they sound like crap. I mean it's been close to two decades, technology of headphones has to have drastically changed. Ah, for the money, its worth a shot."" Got them, opened, popped into my clip+, hit play. Simply put, I love them. These headphones have obviously exceeded my expectations. They are light, audio quality is good, and the form factor is perfect for traveling and using in public. The biggest plus to these headphones is that they are extremely comfortable, and I mean they are almost ""not there"" comfortable. Not to mention, the price is fantastic. I will be buying probably around 2-3 more pairs, so I have backups, and a couple to tinker on. I'm thinking of adding a Rean plug and maybe some braided cord, just for fun not because it's needed.","Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2012",AFAL5SYI4K4MUG7ZPERHV44Y4VVQ,True,186,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R17QSURV2HDF5B,B075LT8YLR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Just okay. There are better options, especially for bass lovers. (Both styles/versions discussed...)",mofo83,3,"Note: I have now tried both the on-ear (older review) and over-ear style (new review) of these headphones. Both reviews are below.New review of Over Ear style:I am pretty experienced now with ""budget"" headphones... I've tried pairs of sub-$25 phones from JVC, Koss, Sony, Panasonic, etc., plus some slightly nicer pairs from Sennheiser, Panasonic, etc.These are solid headphones for the price, but nothing outstanding in my opinion.The higher-end sound is nice and pretty clear, that's where these shine. The low end is weak and flat compared to the competition - the JVC Flats and all of Koss' lower end phones (KTXPro1, PortaPros, etc.) have better bass. If you mostly listen to hip-hop-rap, I'd pass on the Panasonics and look into the Koss/JVC. (NOTE: I just got these, I'll update as they warm up/break-in, but I can't imagine the bass is going to improve THAT much. UPDATE: They might have gotten a hair better in this regard, but not that much...)Comfort-wise, these over-ears are just okay. If you have large ears, I think these might give you trouble - they're a smallish circular shape that could pinch - luckily I have small ears so they juuuust fit inside the pads. The headband is unpadded hard plastic - not as comfortable as the KTXPro1 (which has a nice gel-suspension band) nor the Flats (which are just smaller/lighter.) The angle the earcups sit at is also not quite right for me, and there's no swivel at all - vertically or horizontally! The JVC have vertical swivel (front-to-back) while the KTXPro1 have horizontal (up-and-down) swivel, both of which lead to a better fit.The long cord is appreciated, though I would have liked a lower-profile jack, as it won't work with my relatively slim phone case on. (This is very annoying, actually...)Overall, these are fine - maybe great for the money, depending on what you listen to/head size/etc - but for me, there are just better options out there.UPDATE: I've now also tried Sennheiser HD 202, and those are superior in just about every way: sound quality (especially low-end); comfort (the cups swivel in multiple directions); cord quality (thicker); looks; etc.Older review of On-Ear version:These headphones are fine for the money, but I would definitely suggest that you spend just a little more and get the Koss KTXPRO1 headphones instead.The Koss phones are MUCH more comfortable (I can't stress this enough) and they also sound better. Trust me, your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucks.I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics are somewhat uncomfortable after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.Of course, your head may be different than mine, but I think most users will find the Koss phones more comfortable.Good luck!","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2013",AHQEXQSXWVETI3LMPTZDZ4XPPK3A,True,3,Style: On Ear - No Mic

R1YV5G2BX0LRST,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for me as a frequent airline traveler,JustUs,5,"For my purposes, I absolutely love these headphones.I spend a lot of time on planes (sadly, much of that on British Airways), and I bought these headphones for 1) the compactness/foldability, 2) the inline volume control, 3) the fact that they would cover my ears rather than jam uncomfortably in them. Note that I did not buy these with a first priority on sound quality; sound quality on a loud plane, or even in a loud airport, becomes compromised to some degree regardless of the headset, even with noise-reducing sets.With that caveat, I can say these headphones are serving me perfectly well. 1) They fold up into a discreet little package; I sewed a small denim drawstring bag (5""x6"" laid flat) for the headphones, and there is still ample room for my ipod shuffle, a 2-headphone splitter, and an an extra set of ear buds in the bag as well. 2) The inline volume control is a must for plugging into the jack in your plane seat when listening to in-flight movies. Not having to reach to the armrest volume controls on a long flight is a comfort. 3) These ear phones sit on the outer rim of my ears which I thought would make me ache after a couple of hours; but the padding is generous, and I have worn these back and forth on 11-hr flights for 13 months now and have not experienced great discomfort. I stabilise my head with a U-pillow, and I can even go to sleep for several hours on a plane with these ear phones on. Note that they are much too bulky to wear while lying on your side (though who would try that anyway?).As for the sound quality, these ear phones are certainly excellent for my purposes. I am not using them for exquisite music listening; I am using them to survive my long-distance flights. I will never use the headphones provided by airlines, as 1) the sound of my trusty Panasonic RP-HT277 travel phones is infinitely superior to any airline phones, and 2) the idea of used headphones kind of grosses me out. I have found the sound quality of these phones more than ample to the task of playing in-flight entertainment as well as excellent for playing my ipod music and podcasts while I'm waiting in the airports.A note on durability: I have had these phones for a little over 13 months and have used them many times per week within that time. I have packed them into many a travel bag, have plugged and unplugged them, have run them through countless airport security X-ray machines. They are going strong, no muffling of sound, no shorting out of wires, no funkiness of any kind. They perform just as they did when I first got them.I highly recommend these head phones for anyone looking for a solid set of compact travel phones with some extra comforts like in-line volume control and cushy ear pads. They sound perfectly fine and they've been my trusty travel ally on many a long trip.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2009",AEOKXIA6OS3OZQ3XTW64JNMZH25A,True,118,Style: On Ear - With Volume Control

R1DF9CVV1O21I7,B094YV1S9T,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Execution,KG Grapefruit Supremeo,5,"At the current discount price of $60ish, these headphones are a steal.No app needed, fantastically clear and concise “quick start guide” that covers all the features of these headphones, powerful ANC that doesn’t produce the “ear suck” sensation, they connect quickly and sound great.Most ANC I’ve tried gives me an uncomfortable ear sensation, but I don’t get it at all with these; it deserves a second mention as these headphones made me a believer in ANC. I can’t hear my cat meow, my HVAC system, or bathroom fans. Tv noise is reduced significantly, particularly at lower frequencies.Sound is nice and balanced; these are adequate headphones for their MSRP, and very good at their discount price. Bass is present but controlled in dance music, and not bloat-y in acoustic tracks. Highs are present but not piercing. “Little Wing” sounds crisp and clear, with excellent balance on the bass presence; a surprisingly clean reproduction at this price point! Even heavy tracks with lots of low tom/kick interaction are well articulated. To my ear, a light “v curve” sound profile is audible and lends itself to listening while working, though I would choose a different headphone for a critical listening experience as the imaging is a bit limited (though perfectly adequate for a closed-back headphone at this price point).The ear cups are a bit crowded feeling on my ears. I don’t think I have big ears, but they completely fill the ear cups. Clamping pressure is a bit tight on first listen, but I’ve either adapted or it chills out after wearing for a bit. Cushions are plush and comfy. These aren’t the lightest headphone I’ve ever put on, but they aren’t too heavy to listen for hours. Ear cups rotate 90 degrees so they can easily be put around your neck, and the build feels sturdy for all plastic construction. They do fold at the ear cups, but no fold in the headband prevents them from being truly “packable”.Button layout also deserves a mention as well. All the buttons are easy to get to and logical, with ANC being located in an easy to find spot and the power button located where it won’t be accidentally bumped. Play/pause, fwd/rev track, voice assistant and 2 device pairing are all available and logical.Haven’t had these long enough to evaluate battery life, but I have no reason to believe they won’t live up to their rating. I’ll update if this changes.This is one of several JBL products I’ve purchased in the last couple years, and my experiences have built a high level of trust in their products. Starting with their cheapest gaming headset, I’ve consistently encountered sturdy products that punch well above their price tag. Personally, I would always recommend a JBL product over the other in vogue brands, even at full price. With the discount on these at $60, the purchase is a no-brainer.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2022",AGDNTOTI5TLRQ4ZZG7INOWLIPNGQ,True,51,Color: BlueStyle: Lightweight
R2ZA048QM91QK1,B094YV1S9T,5.0 out of 5 stars More comfortable than Bose with same quality sound,Shawkins,5,"I had some JBLs for years that I loved. I loaned them to a 7 year old once and they came back broken. I thought now was the time to try different brands. I tried Skullcandy and Bose. Surprisingly, the Skullcandy ones had awful sound. They were some kind of bass boosting ones, so maybe they weren't their top of the line ones? The Bose were like $300+. These JBLs are more comfortable and sound just as good. I ended up keeping these and the Bose thinking that I must be missing something with the Bose ones, like maybe an app that adjusts the sound. But nothing about the Bose has outweighed these. JBLs seem to be pretty reliable. My last ones lasted me five years of perfect sound and connectivity before the kiddo broke them. Even after that, they still worked! The ear piece was just broken off in a way that made them unusable. The only downside to me (but I've experienced this with all headphones) is how much you can hear them when you aren't wearing them. Other people can hear what I'm listening to. This is fine at a gym with a lot of other sounds going on. And still works for early morning work meetings when I don't want to wake the others in my house. But if you were on a plane with these, the person in the seat next to you would hear noise from them. Probably annoying. Regardless, they are comfortable, sound great, and based on how well my old ones held up, I think these will last.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2023",AHLRS3VMRYRTCA76FO6EDXS7KJSA,True,47,Color: WhiteStyle: Lightweight

The sound quality was great! The sound cancellation was awesome! They were very comfortable and the buttons were easy to learn. The battery hold was pretty good too.BUT just 2 days ago I was watching a video and the audio just cut out and it was just a steady tone. I thought the video I was watching cut out or froze but it was still going. I realized it was the headphones so I tried to shut them off. They wouldn’t turn off nothing I could do could get them to turn off to like restart. They died over night I guess because in the morning they were off. I charged them for an hour and the battery light wouldn’t even turn on. I left it for a while to charge and they never turned back on.

R3LSCVSHG5NYAE,B094YV1S9T,5.0 out of 5 stars These cans can still deliver the JBL nostalgia!!!!!!!!!!,space kiddet,5,"Let me make this emphatically clear!!!; I needed Bluetooth 🎧 because the three-month-old Samsung Q60A panel had the venerable, vital & still eminently practical headphone jack port purged from its componentry endowment, which meant much to my chagrin that a still functional-year-old JBL E35 headphones are obsolete destined to be a hoarder's dust🐇hutch and 🕷🕸condo!Admittedly, it came down to this model & my original selection for acquisition, the Tune 710. Still, when someone else beat me to the last Tune 710, I read an Australian review that noted that except for the Noise Cancel addition, the Tune 710 & the Tune 760 are fraternal doppelgangers! So, naturally, when the 760 showed up here combined with a Gen. Grant-sized discount, I seized it up like either an 🦅or a 🐻 snapping a salmon from a river!I had the impression that, via the specifications, these tins would sound similar to the E35s, but when the 760s became operational, 😱! They sound like the Endurance Peak buds I have, loudly & proudly dishing out a bounty of bodacious bass, mounds of musical midrange, and triumphant transcendent treble; in addition, I could perfectly discern instrument separation while the cans were paired with my Samsung Galaxy A52 5g. However, the headphone couldn't connect to the Q60A. It didn't help that I read further about both JBL and Samsung having issues with Low latency APTX causing me to contemplate blowing bucks on small-time Chinese cabecilla nadie cans until August 6th, which was two days ago, when a local Geek Squad Guru succeeded in connecting both gadgets by making me unpair the headphone then delete it from the smartphone, then shut both down for a minute then cut on the TV to delete the phantom gadget then restart the 760 to coax the tv into recognizing the phones. Once the 760 shows up on the BT speaker option, select that & they are united! & they sound soooo good! With the 760 still doing superbly sonorous thru the panel speakers with the remnant issues being having to pump up the volume of the TV from 15 to 85 & the NC seems vestigial, but then, for now, I don't need the NC. I also hope to master the button combo procedure to make calls and link the 760 back to the A52 and Q60AIn conclusion, it was the quality of the headphone that encouraged me to persevere until prevailing rather than giving in the return reflex!Update: 16 August 2022-Noise Cancelation enables me to lower the volume level from 85 to as low as 60. I hope I find other benefits of this feature & I'm not misusing the technology.","Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2022",AHR2HVADX4IGRM7V267GYCXJMM5Q,True,35,Color: WhiteStyle: Lightweight

Usually they hug the side of your head a little closer. I’ll add a pic to show you what I mean.

R1M34WRV263F1D,B094YV1S9T,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality and comfortable noise cancellation,justanotherguy,5,"Review for the JBL 760NC headphonesAudio quality compares favourably to mid-range wired headphones like Audio Technica M50's or mid-range Sennheiser.Extremely crisp and clear sound, bass is pleasant and well reproduced. Don't expect anything too high end or punchy, probably because of the driver size, but the range is functional and a joy for listening. If this is your first purchase of quality headphones (and Beats are not quality) then you'll be very pleased.Noise cancellation, this is probably the most important feature that makes this pair of headphones really stand out. They're the only pair of noise cancelling headphones I've tried that haven't been uncomfortable or induced pain or unpleasant pressure on the ear. Beats out Bose, Anker sound core, Sony for noise cancelling comfort. The actual amount of noise cancelling is less, but it will probably save you from getting hit by a bus. A worthwhile tradeoff.Physical comfort is very good, easy to forget I'm wearing them for short periods. The ear cups are very plush. The band pressure may be a bit much if you want to wear them all day but you'd probably want over-ear headphones instead of on-ear headphones at that point.Battery life is great. Pairing is simple and easy.The overall design, feel, packaging, included cords etc are all high quality. It even shipped with tissue paper wrapping the box to protect the box from scratches, which was a nice touch.In my experience, JBL has high quality large format offerings in great studio and event speakers, but I haven't been very impressed with their portable offerings until now.At $65 US, if you're considering purchasing them, it's a great deal.","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2023",AEIX36RBBCQ66NWDLE2FTRIYQ6FQ,True,8,Color: BlueStyle: Lightweight

R2JXQRLFWRSA1K,B094YV1S9T,4.0 out of 5 stars Fits tiny heads!! FINALLY,AC,4,"Ok, so this has been my 4th pair I've ordered. The previous ones did not fit my tiny dome and just flop around on my head or fall off, not these! They actually fit (without having to move the band) and are comfortable to wear around. They weren't as over-ear as I was wanting, but they are comfortable and I actually don't mind them after they've been on a while. Sound quality is decent, I've got no complaints but I'm also no audiophile. Noise cancelling is ok, it does help with blocking out lower noises. I've noticed when talking on the phone, the volume is pretty low and I have to turn it up quite a bit to be able to hear but I am able to do it comfortably.All said and done, I am mostly happy with them. My major complaint is that I don't think these warrant their price tag. The 3 other (less expensive) pairs I tried all did the same things without a noticeable difference in quality from these. I feel a little stuck with these because they do the things I wanted, and they actually fit my head, they are just not in the price range I feel like they should be in.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AHXYEHU5RMPD72HLC3PBNM2KCSBA,True,30,Color: BlackStyle: Lightweight

It is now June of 2024, and they will no longer accept a charge. I have used JBL products, both consumer level and pro level for over 25 years and have never been disappointed until now. The sound quality was very good, even for a wireless headset, and allowed me to watch a multitude of different media, from action movies to classical concerts with an acceptable level of reproduction, and without “treating the sound” the way other products do. Now, I hesitate to purchase another JBL product. I gave the product two stars instead of one, because during their short time of operation, they were very enjoyable and comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AHICQNBYAHU57XQJY626SU4UVOYA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Lightweight
R1JZQGOED51JCG,B094YV1S9T,2.0 out of 5 stars Really Wanted to Love Them but the Quality Didn't Live Up to my Expectations,Gianna M.,2,"I gave these headphones a good long time to test them out before returning them. I wanted to like them because JBL typically makes good products but these headphones aren't one of them-unless I got a defect. The headphones would randomly disconnect from whatever device I was using, which is especially frustrating when it happens in a call, despite having a full battery. Also, unlike other headphones I had that would automatically connect to the last device it was paired with when both the headphones and device were turned on, I had to manually connect my headphones each time. The plastic of the headphones also lead to some annoying sounds. I would turn my head slightly and something inside the headphones would make a sudden and loud click sound in my ear that was annoying and distracting. The headphones were also not the most comfortable, feeling tight around my ears.In terms of audio quality, they were alright. Nothing horrible. Passable for what I wanted them for when in stereo mode. In hands-free mode however the audio is atrocious; audio typically loses some quality when in hands-free mode no matter the headphones, but for these headphones it was remarkably bad. In regards to the noise cancellation, it doesn't really work too well at all. Like I can still hear me lightly typing on my keyboard with them on which is frustrating given how they are supposed to be active noise cancelling.Overall, just disappointing for the price and the brand.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2024",AEVGNGPLSI6MH4JOCBOZOIYVFYBA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Lightweight

Vengo de usar audifonos comunes y quería tener un poco más de calidad en el audio (Generalmente para música mientras trabajo y juegos) pero sobreestimé la calidad de los audífonos. La verdad mis audifonos de chupón normales se escuchan mejor que estos. Eso sí, estos son MUY cómodos y la batería le dura un montón.Con la cancelación de ruido tuve un problema, no sé si es un problema de los audífonos que tengo o de todos en general, pero si uso la cancelación de ruido con el volumen alto, se escucha que algo por dentro ""se mueve"" y lo hace al ritmo del bajo, lo cual es muuy molesto. Es como si tuviera algo suelto por dentro.- Sonido: 6.5/10. El sonido no es muy fuerte aunque se escucha muy bien, algunas veces extraño que suenen fuerte (aclaro: se escuchan decente, pero a veces hace falta ese poquito más de volumen)- Comodidad: 10/10. Nada que decir acá, son muy cómodos, los uso unos 30-45 minutos y no incomodan- Batería: 10/10. Me duran unos 15-20 días sin cargar- Cancelación de ruido: Aunque es la primera vez que uso unos auriculares con cancelación, estos dejan que desear. No cancelan tanto los sonidos pero si te crean esa sensación de ""estar inmerso""- Calidad de construcción: 10/10 se sienten muy bien y en color azul que pedí quedan elegantes.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2023",AGNDA3VDISLMMDFHIM65CAWFYQAA,True,3,Color: BlueStyle: Lightweight

I usually adjust by placing the cushion on top of the upper portion of the ear. Again, after a couple hours is completely tolerable for my usage but may not be if needed for extended periods of time.Sound: clean, but a little lacking in volume. Probably for the best, but definitely should be noted.Pros: The battery feels eternal, 50 hours of charge is massive, I’ve yet to charge them since I’ve purchased.Build Quality: nice! Feels quality. Actually like the buttons on the headphone and the placement is thoughtful.EQ: presets are decent for most needs.Price: honestly think the price is competitive with higher end products, but gets dragged on the noise cancelling capabilities and volume.Would I suggest these as a great pair of headphones?

R350RH0BWMBO33,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Want ANC Headphones with $$$ sound but under $60? These deliver that & more IMHO UPDATE Dec 2023,Carolina,5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019! Ankar is truly hard to beat. Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause. On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results. They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price. He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones. 2) the headband could use a slight redesign. Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about. Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound. I like a variety of music & I hear good bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones. That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE: if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight. The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on. These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance. When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2020",AFSQEHFGI4GKAV6ZLXDEBCO5FQPQ,True,381,Color: Black
R1BQMJJBRP2JKK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation for and unbeatable price,Ollie,5,"I have never owned a high-end Bose or Sony noise cancellation headphone so understand the context of my experience.My use case is commuting on Amtrak while also using those hours to work, and at home, drowning out outside music and neighbors loudly chatting. This Q20 performs perfectly for my needs. All the background noise on the train is barely audible and the sound quality of music and lectures is perfect as far as I'm concerned. One weakness is that voices are still relatively clear due to background noise being muted.In comparison to the Beats Studio Pro which I previously used and costs 3x as much, the Q20 is superior in sound quality, noise cancellation and comfort. The Q20 also presses evenly around the ear while the Beat Studio Pro exerts more pressure on the lower end of the headphone and presses harshly against the jaw while less on the upper end. Very uncomfortable at least for me. Q20 is the entry level and with an entry level price but outstanding performance. I've wondered if I should have purchased the Q30 or 45 but considering the comparison with Beats, I'm extremely happy with the Q20. Per some of the other reviews regarding build quality, I do handle mine gently though.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AHGYTRNPF27FJ5DP2NZIJQEFBU7Q,True,13,Color: Black
RMO3BYL4R5F6X,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good budget headphones,Justin,4,"I bought these because I wanted a cheap (inexpensive) set of headphones for the gym to replace my AirPods Pro. I was getting tired of fiddling around with the silicone wing attachments for the AirPods.The quality of these Q20’s seems pretty decent and they are comfortable, though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time.The sound quality isn’t as great as what you would expect from a more expensive set of headphones, but that was to be expected and they sound pretty good for the price.Noise cancellation in general is pretty weird to me, so I’m not sure how good or bad it is in these Q20’s when it works, but I wasn’t impressed. When I tested it sitting in my room, it did a decent job at drowning out the ambient noise like the hum of my fan, etc. I did notice that ANC does reduce the volume a bit.However, at the gym I felt like the ANC was struggling to work properly. While I was on the stationary bike, it kept alternating between drowning out the ambient noise and letting it through. It sounded as if I was lifting one of the ear cups and then setting it back over my ear repeatedly. Didn’t notice it too much after that, but not sure if I just got used to it.The bass boost feature does add a little more thump to your music but sacrifices audio clarity, so I definitely wouldn’t use it.Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for $40, audio quality is good, ANC is alright, and they are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AHJQELHY4ARFZHT5HDCBSP3UVGQQ,True,14,Color: Black
R38XUNRK6U9DLP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent product with good sound quality and noise cancel and battery life but with just one flaw,Fani,5,"This is a fantastic product. I bought it because I wanted something for my flight overseas to reduce the plane hum noise which drastically reduces jet lag.So I bought this and I was amazed how great it wasPros:* great construction, feels sturdy* good choice of colors* came with USB charge cable and regular 3.5mm (I think) jack wire so it plugged into all audio out* bluetooth pairs fast and easily* noise cancelation is excellent* sound quality overall is just amazing* the thing goes over your ears nicely without hurting your ears or making it feel like it's on fire after an hour. It has soft padding and cushioned so it really helps* you feel the whoosh -> reduced sound as soon as you put it over your ear and it auto-enables noise cancel when you power it on which is great and tells you ""Battery high"" etc. which is great* battery life is amazing. Charged it once for like 2-3hours to max and it worked for 15hr flight to and another 15hr flight back and it still said Battery high. I didn't use it all the time. Maybe for like 60-70% of the time which is still great* colors are nice and make it look classy.* it doesn't cause any issues with the band over the head* you can use it wired without needing to power it on so it uses extremely little battery* the controls are fine and the ear muffs are labeled R and L which is a nice touch* haven't tested bluetooth range but I figure it is maybe standard of working across a large room* price is very good for the performance. Sure it is not a Bose ($350+) or JVC ($200+) or some others but for $40-$50 this is truly fantastic.Cons:* the one and only con I found is if you plug in the audio jack the noise cancelation turns off immediately which is a shame. So on the plane I was watching a movie where the audio came in nicely but I could hear the little plane hum as well (it was muted but not noise canceled).Other:* didn't test the bass boost but I'm sure it is great.Overall, I liked it so much I bought 2 of them. My teenage son loved it too and he said they're really great quality and works well.

R15YTZVPTWKV6S,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best budget friendly gym headphones,Landon,5,"I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice.

RHOPBCTZD9LDU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable Price:Performance!,Joel,5,"I've had the Soundcore Q20 headphones for almost a month now, and I thought I'd start off my review with one simple statement: I've only charged these things ONCE since I've taken them out of the box. These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",AG2IY3MWQWDS3BEK37557MIKDP2Q,True,544,Color: Black
R3HQTCIS9L4E3N,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great performance and comfort for transcribing,Krista,5,"I've had these Soundcore Anker LQ20 headphones for a year and have been using them heavily the entire time. They're still going strong and I love them. They're comfortable and the noise cancellation is good. I work from home as a transcriptionist, and I use them for a few hours to several hours a day. They do a good job of blocking or significantly reducing background noises like TV, a noisy AC, lawn mowers, and nearby semi-loud voices. If you use the button to turn off the active noise canceling feature, you'll hear the difference right away.This pair was my first time trying bluetooth headphones for transcribing. I wasn't sure if the sound quality would be as good as wired headphones/good enough for me to accurately transcribe all speech from the audio files I work with, including ones with difficult audio, and I also wondered if there would be any issues with the bluetooth connection being spotty or something. They have worked perfectly and I find them to be very good transcription headphones.I have to charge them fairly often since I use them so much, but I think they have at least average battery life between charges. I usually charge as soon as I notice the voice says ""Battery medium"" at startup because I've learned they'll probably run out in the middle of my work session if I try to wait until it says ""Battery low."" I don't think I've ever even heard ""Battery low.""Great headphones, reasonable price, no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AGS2HV55N4RN6XK44IT7I5KYHFUA,True,8,Color: Black

Now in 2024 they are starting to break down, it started with band plastic part randomly breaking off. Now the fake leather is starting to peel pretty bad. There are a few factors that could be causing this. 1. I dont store them in the pouch it came with (its my jewelry bag now). 2. I had them hanging on my office desk near my humidifier which i would put essential oils in. And 3 the headphones were in the sun often because my desk was near a window and i live in California.Despite all that this year was the 1st year i used them on an airplane and watched Dune for the 1st time. Noise cancelling was on point, and the sound was beautiful. Besides having pieces of leather on my shirt when taking them off they are still rockin and fit great.

R1REYVNBG5AVBE,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars There are no better BT headphones under $100,Carl Payne,5,"UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.Wow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2022",AGD5QTRAY6ASQKN7OMV3PC6POPSQ,True,1628,Color: Black
R1ABEIBHVJQEA4,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice in budget friendly headphones,Miranda,4,"They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AEX7BTHOU63GYGKQTAAC6HSPITZA,True,28,Color: Black
R325WZ955J5MAO,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Super-Solid Bang-For-Your-Buck Pair of Headphones!,Jordan Pon,4,"Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020",AF57TFFL4RVTI3RUQXVEO24IMNTQ,True,442,Color: Black
RTYYTUIZAG0EK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A Complete Review for the Average Joe,Kathy Tran,5,"This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020",AEBWJZ55L7XV3T354S22VM2GQK7Q,True,678,Color: Black
R3TBHJ0I0G4WY0,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase for an overstimulated mom!,Alex G.,5,"Let me start by saying I wasn’t paid or given the product for free to say this….these are my genuine thoughts. I started looking for some over the ear headphones bc, as a mom to a small baby, I spend a lot of time awake at night on my phone trying to stay awake! I have regular Apple ear buds and never liked them bc they don’t stay in my ear at all. I chose this soundcore product bc it had the best reviews and was in my budget. I was immediately in love. I’m no expert in sound by no means but I do love music and love when things sound so clear and crisp. This delivers so well in that. The noise cancelling is my favorite part. As a mom to a very wild toddler, I can get overstimulated to the max. This makes it so that I can hear the screaming and laughing but it sounds like through a mile long tunnel, which is PERFECT. I’m sure other people would like more noise reduction but this is amazing for me to lessen all the noise but still be alert if needed. I suffer from migraines so the fit is a huge aspect to me. They seem very comfortable so far but using them for longer will surely tell. I wish there were more colors like a pale pink but I got the silver color and it is girly enough for me! It’s something I’d definitely wear outside the house at the gym or on a walk. They haven’t gone through a drop test yet which I’m sure they will bc again, wild toddler. But they seem to be durable and not super cheaply made. I do wish there was a hard case as all it came with was a rubber plastic bag. I’m sure I could find something cheap on Amazon though to fit. Overall, I LOVE IT.

R2PRRSGGO8J48X,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars The Absolute BEST for Misophonia, Hyperacusis, and Sound/Sensory Sensitivity",sbonne,5,"I own so much sound defense equipment it's almost ridiculous. I have everything from Loop ear plugs to noise-canceling ear buds to sound machines to big speakers. I have a condition that makes certain sounds nd frequencies quite painful. Until now, every device I have tried had failed to provide complete relief. I wasn't expecting much of the Soundcore Q20 headphones, but if you struggle with sound sensitivity, you know the desperation for relief. My biggest battle has been my next door neighbor's lawn service, which uses equipment that measures over 90dB INSIDE my house with all the windows closed. I usually have to leave the house the moment I hear the truck pull up. Not anymore! I put the Soundcore Q20s to the test just this week, fully expecting that the lawn equipment (particularly the gas-powered leaf blowers) would make it through like it does all other devices I own, but it didn't! I was stunned! Even between songs, the noise cancellation kept my ears protected from the auditory assault I usually have to leave the house to escape. These are worth their weight in gold! I cannot recommend them enough. And in addition to being absolutely excellent at what they're designed to do, they provide great sound quality for music and they fit very comfortably. I don't usually like having things on or around my ears but these are quite tolerable. The cushioning feels nice, and there is more cushioning on the part that goes on top of your head. Oh, and the battery life? Phenomenal!! These charge quickly and the charge lasts for a very long time! Bottom line: whether you deal with hyperacusis, misophonia, sensory processing disorder, or just really value your peace and quiet, GET THESE. There are brands out there that cost a lot more and promise a better experience, but these are BY FAR superior to anything else I have ever tried. They will not disappoint! These would make a wonderful gift for the person in your life that struggles with sound or has autism or ADHD and needs relief from noise and external distractions. Literally a life-changing product. I'd give them more stars if I could!","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2024",AH3JNQIYXWKIX5M3KYYWBSX6J5KA,True,7,Color: Black

R2D5N7MVCP2FAP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud office? BUY THESE!,Katy Jordan,5,"Recently, a group of half a dozen younger, rather talkative, gentlemen were promoted to my department. I'm okay with chitchat at a nice reasonable level. But as the NBA Finals approached, their enthusiasm for daily conversations seemed to grow. I overheard rave reviews of various comedy and action films and television shows. I've listened to them flirt shamelessly with the one younger girl at their desk clump. I also overheard a particularly vivacious discussion about chewing gum that lasted approximately half an hour. It felt something akin to working in a locker room slash Dutch Bros. parking lot slash mall food court. Their volume grew. And grew. And I was afraid that one day I might be inclined to staple something to one of their heads if I heard one more thing about what the Mavericks can do to get more rebounds in the next game. My current earbuds were not working - I had to keep raising the volume, prolonged wearing made my ears itchy, and somehow I could still hear the boys! Desperate, I saw these headphones for a reasonable price and thought I'd take the chance.As soon as they were over my ears, it was like I'd stepped into an oasis. I could finally hear my own thoughts. Instant focus. I have become much more pleasant to be around. I no longer feel compelled to staple things to my coworkers heads. In fact, now I find these boys quite endearing and I hope all of their sports teams win.The noise cancelling is not perfect, but for the price it is amazing. I also have loop earplugs for concerts - if that helps as a reference point, these headphones cancel more noise than that. I don't have to turn the volume of my music up as high. They really are quite pleasant - that's the best word I can think of to describe them. They're adjustable, so they fit my head perfect, and perfectly cover my ears. I've heard other people say that other headphones start to feel heavy after a while and strain their necks - I have not felt that with these at all. They are comfortable, they look sleek, the battery seems to last forever, and I HIGHLY recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AH73MYPRDV2TK2KOUSR4BVVTMNCA,True,49,Color: Black
R3L3SZ6RUZTBSX,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding, but not without their flaws",Debbie Wiggins,4,"These headphones are a great value. They are extremely lightweight and sound quality is very good. Noise cancelling works well and is not far off from their more expensive counterparts. My main complaint with these is the size of the ear cups. They are quite small and just barely qualify as ""over ear"" headphones in my opinion. Part of the ear cup actually sat on top of my ear lobes. I found that this design along with the faux-leather material used made my ears overheat too quickly. That being said, I have issues with my ears getting hot with most headphones that I have tried, so take that with a grain of salt.It is important to mention that I could not get the noise cancelling feature to work when these were functioning off of the included cable. If you plan to use these wirelessly just for listening to music from your phone this likely isn't an issue, but I was considering using these for gaming so this did not fit my use case. In addition, I feel that these do not sound nearly as good with noise cancelling turned off. When noise cancelling is on, they sound amazing. With it off, however, they sound quite cheap and the clarity seems to decrease. I'm not sure what would cause this, but that is just my experience with them.I got these on sale for $40, so these are definitely a great value at that price point. If the negatives I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, I highly recommend picking these up when they are on sale.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHSWFP7XSW3WSEK2XFIOZOMVMP2A,True,3,Color: Black
R8A53BVTBUUTM,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,Wendell Powell,5,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2020",AHAP5LT732R5D4AMGRRZYHQCNNJQ,True,489,Color: Black
R3JEJFEWVA44XJ,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Nice sound quality but the fit takes some getting used to,Whit,4,"The controls on the headphones are really easy to use whether you want to pause whatever you’re listening to or adjust the volume of your headphones without taking them off to troubleshoot (my last pair from a different brand were so hard to pause, adjust volume, etc so this is a really great perk for my new headphones). I ordered the black pair and they look great. They’re easy to connect with my Bluetooth on my phone however the distance I can be away from my phone while I am connected isn’t that great. But if you keep your phone on or near you while you use them it isn’t an issue. The noise canceling feature works pretty well. I haven’t tried them in a super busy and loud setting yet but they do a good job dulling the sound of my lawn mower and leaf blower while I’m doing my yard work. The fit takes some getting used to. If I wear them too long my ears get sore and the top of my head where the strap sits starts to hurt too. But I haven’t worn over the ear headphones in a really long time so it may just be that my head and ears need time to get used to the new set up. Overall for the price I’d recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AFTJWQAYUSUI7GS36WR3YK56W2IQ,True,1,Color: Black

I was blown away by the ability to be noise canceling at the touch of a button. These came in today and I’ve been wearing them all day! I can’t say that I notice any difference between them and the AirMax. I own a vast amount of headphones, most that I’ve gotten off Amazon below $30. These were the first pair I spent more on, got them for $39.99 on sale from $59.99. I’m just a headphone junkie. These are fantastic! I’m obsessed and they are now my favorite pair. I will probably be purging some old ones soon. They’re all fairly decent for how much I paid for them, but these are absolutely my favorite!

R3V6S1FQYWLWPU,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars An Honest, Unbiased Review **UPDATED**",Marc,4,"UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020",AFWC3HQORHDCFQJN4P76FBRXOI7A,True,33,Color: Black
R3LYQ2WI5N0KRF,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good For Our TV Use, But Question the BT 5.3 Rating",Bob in Central Oregon,5,"We bought two of these to use for TV listening. We have a large difference in how much TV volume we need, and the easiest solution is two headphones with individual volume adjustments. I have a long history of success with Anker products so had no problem selecting these from the large assortment of BT headphones available on Amazon in this cost class. At the same time I bought a https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G8Q7NXZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details transceiver for the TV, also with BT 5.3 low-latency claimed.The headphones paired easily with the transceiver. The sound quality is fine, and they link up quickly when powered on. The only disappointment is that there's a very noticeable lag in the audio, even with both components claiming the low-latency with BT 5.3. Unfortunately I have no other BT 5.3 pieces to substitute to isolate the cause of the lag. Since they will be used with the TV speaker turned off, the lag isn't as critical an issue as it might be if the TV speaker was still audible while wearing the headphones. Were I serious about testing/solving, I'd me much more inclined to swap he transceiver first.I did the first test while pairing with the transceiver plugged into my tablet, listening to a music stream. My vintage (read: old) ears liked the bass-boost function for the music, so one set of headphones has that selected. K has hearing loss in upper mid to treble range so bass boost would not benefit her, and in fact would be counterproductive. Hers is switched off. Nice to have that easy option. I have no other sound options selected at this early time.Yes I would buy them again. They are comfortable, fold nicely if I was planning to pack them for travel, certainly light weight on the head, and they will serve our needs nicely.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AGEBMVNXJABW4OKRV2MP7NS6FX6A,True,3,Color: Black

I was gonna buy them but then I saw these as the 2nd on the list at $49!!They mention the “active noise reduction” feature, so I figured, ya can’t go wrong with that price these days. The reviews were plentiful but, I’m very weary of excessive Amazon reviews because, for the most part, it basically tells me that the product was inexpensive.Nevertheless I purchased them and WOW!Syncing to my iPhone was a breeze.

R1V2HAPIO5YL64,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars No noise cancelling, instead this is more like pump up the volume",William Yousef Fadel,4,"Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent) sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2020",AF2NHPCDCZUYJXEC4KAFWB73FFRA,True,16,Color: Black

R14MJTIQHLNJV5,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good for the price,Jenna,4,"The noise cancelling isn’t the greatest, but for the price point, I wasn’t expecting much. They’re great for around the house, but on a plane or train, they don’t block out much. I ended up wearing foam ear plugs with these on top with sleep sounds playing, and I could still hear people around me and the engine humming.The sound quality is pretty good for music and podcasts. They’re lightweight enough for be comfortable for extended wear. And my favorite thing about them… the battery lasts forever (I use them several hours every day and only charge them once a week).I use them a lot for phone calls, and I’ve been told the microphone picks up a lot of background noise, so they’re not great if you’re trying to get other things done while talking to someone. The audio clarity lets you hear everything the other person is doing as well.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AFFK6LCAHRBUOSTEPGKDRGZNN3BQ,True,1,Color: Black
R5SDX41KD57A9,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,Steven Lavey,5,"I've been using thease headphones for a while now and I feel like I've tested them enough to give a long term review. The headphones work great from day 1. They came partially charged. Disregarding the advice of plugging in and giving a full charge before use, used it all the way to see how long it would take to fully charge. First full charge was about 2 hours. Every full charge has been between 30 to 90 minutes. This is due to the quality of charger and cord used. In the instructions it says it has a quick charge mode where 5 minutes of charge gives 2 hours. I've found this is incorrect. 5 minutes of charge gives about 2.5 hours of use at minimum. I can usually get a full or nearly full charge at 45 minutes at average. Standby mode with headphones is the longest I've seen. I powered on the headphones and needed to do something, forgot about it until 2 days later. At 2 days standby with Noise cancelation on, the charge was about 20%. Noise cancelation works great. I've been using the headphones while doing woodworking. I doubt the headphones are OSHA approved but they work great with background noise. When I was listening to anything, I did not need to adjust the volume to hear anything. While I know this company as a very reliable company for USB cords and chargers, the headphones and earbuds they make are some of the best I've used and an excellent value. The only recommendation I would make is to change the charging port from micro USB to USB C, but I'm sure they've already corrected it with other models. There's not many companies out there that I'd ever consider myself a fan of, let alone recommend their products to close family members, this company is certainly one I do. The fit if the headphones are perfect, even with people who wear glasses.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2024",AEQCO42XNU4WFC6TTDMJOKFJNB5A,True,11,Color: Blue

I wasn't particularly fascinated by how low the sound was at first, especially with my music player mediums being at full volume... BUT THEN I eventually realized that the Noise Cancellation feature had something to do with that, so I turned it off. The EQ quality is spotless; the clarity and balance is top notch! The bass boost is very enjoyable, the product aesthetic is excellent, I love that it comes with a case for carrying and packing, the buttons are straightforward, and the headphones seem to fit well over small heads and big heads, Haha! Audiophile folks may indulge in the ANC technology, but I prefer it with that feature off because more power is needed to make the sonics more attractive to me. I prefer my headphones and earbuds to be loud enough for me to fully submerge myself in the music, so I can drown in the frequencies to catch the vibe of each song.I started with ""New Review"" because this is a modification of my prior review. I deleted my old review after discovering that turning off the ANC feature gives me the kind of loudness I enjoy when listening to music. It increased the performance of the headphones for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AHFXESDXT5IPIGMGNBKGIFZUE2OA,True,0,Color: Black

The build quality is very good for the price (I bought it for 40 USD). My only complain is the active noise cancelling, which when turned on, lower the bass quality of the music (on Spotify at least). That's why I don't usually turn on the active noise cancelling, the good thing is that you probably are not going to need it, I can't hear people talking when playing music.One of the best things of this product is the battery. I didn't charge it for one month and I've been using it almost all days, 3 or 5 ours by day, and just got the ""low battery"" announce.I would totally recommend this product.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AEJBFO24VD72AJELCJWHHM4MVAEQ,True,0,Color: Black

The sound quality is decent but I wouldn't say outstanding by any means. Actually seem to get better sound through Bluetooth than wired which seems odd but hey you're buying BT phones anyways so... The noise cancellation is very weak, basically non-existent it seems to only filter out lows, like I can still hear my fan running in my window 15ft from me. Controls are simple and easy to use. My main gripe is that every time you move you can hear the various joints and whatnot creaking. Overall for like sitting watching a movie without disturbing your partner, grand, but I wouldn't use them as like day-to-day walking around cans if you really love your music.

Sure. They’re not Sony. They’re not Sennheiser. But if you’re like me and you just need some tunes to tune out the world when you’re commuting, walking, working, or eating, these do the job.Keep in mind, I treat my headphones like garbage. I lost the case/bag it came in so any time I don’t need it, it gets stuffed in my backpack or thrown somewhere for me to find later. After more than a year of this kind of use, it’s still sturdy and holding strong. I haven’t even put duct tape on it, which is more than what I can say about my previous pair.Will I get the same exact pair after this inevitably dies? …No. There are better options out there nowadays. But if you’re looking for a gift for a cranky high schooler or a new college admit…hell, I’d do anything for a pair of these my freshman year in college rather than the 5 other bad, dollar-store hand-me-downs I went through.Brief description about its functionality because you might need to keep this in mind: They’re very comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in these before. However, they do have a tendency to slip off after continuous usage so I don’t really recommend this if you’re looking to run or jog or work out. They fold in, which is great for storage. They sit around my neck easily but I have weird sensory issues with that so I don’t usually rest them there. (It’s not uncomfortable but it’s also not comfortable.) And one final thing: lately, they’ve needed a LOT of time to charge. HOWEVER, even since I’ve gotten these headphones, they last an INCREDIBLE amount of time. I think my first few times using it I’ve literally had it on 5-7 hours a day for like, two weeks, and it still has charge on it. The battery life is god tier. Nowadays, it has been more like 4-6 hours for 1 1/2-2 weeks before I need to charge it. I’ve left these suckers on during classes and meetings and man, I’m always surprised by the voice telling me I’m still on a medium charge.Don’t take my word for it though. I got a couple of friends who have been rocking their own pairs of q25s for about as long as I have, if not longer.These are solid.

With that being said, as far as cost goes, Anker is up there in price, but not the MOST expensive. For the price point on noise cancelling headphones, I went with these and let me tell you they are AMAZING! I know someone that paid twice as much for their noise cancelling headphones and I like these better! The noise cancelling is a God send, its helps me study and relax in peace. If you only have noise cancelling on and no other noise playing, you will still hear SOME noise, but it is much more muted and quiet. The sound quality on these far exceeds my expectations. If you need heavy, heavy bass, these might not be for you, but they do the job for me. The charge for me, lasts days, with the headphones being on for multiple hours per day. One downfall I want to mention is you cannot use these and charge them at the same time (unless maybe I'm dong something wrong), but that wasn't a huge deal for me anyway as I just let them charge overnight. These are soooooo great, I let my friend borrow them and he ended up buying himself and his mom a pair!

Green,5,"I saw these on a Today's Deal sale, and like a drug addict that likes hopscotch, I busted out the chalk sidewalk and started researching.Everyone loves these headphones. Your mom will love these headphones. They are not $300 Bose ANC headphones. (ANC stands for Always Be Closing. Sit Down. Coffee is for closers.) But they are 80-90% as good as Bose Active Noise Cancelling headphones at 1/5 the cost. You'll need to ask your kid or younger brother to help with that Algebra, but let's just say x = incredible value.Apparently Soundcore is an Anker company. This isn't obvious in some of the reviews you will undoubtedly read while on the toilet. But it's Anker made. Who hasn't had great experience with Anker stuff? Your purchase history here on Amazon already has 14 Anker purchases. This won't be your first or your last Anker purchase. Aside from making you feel dumb with your friends because no one can agree how to pronounce the ""a"" in Anker, their products are solid performers at a good price.And that's how I'd describe these headphones - like a really nice Honda amongst Acura, Lexus, etc. Or a really good TV dinner where they get the cheese right. These Soundcores are not beautiful. They won't help you get the girl (or the guy. or the cute non-binary person you saw Wednesday). But they absolutely will make you feel glad you bought them.They are solid in the hand, if a little cheap feeling - but only next to high end headphones. They aren't flimsy by any stretch (do not try to stretch them). The plastic is thick and has a matte finish. The headband adjustment is solid - easy to move and stays in place once set. Comfort is excellent. The earphone cushions are buttery soft (and not all greasy like butter. That would be gross. Butter on your ears sucks.) The soft ear cushions make a great seal on your ears and don't hurt after wearing for hours, even with glasses.Some reviewes mention that these headphones can get a little sweaty. That does not mean the headphones themselves. These headphones produce almost zero perspiration themselves. But they may make your head/ears/ear area sweat. Because of the great seal made by the cushions, and due to the material being all natural vinyl or something, it can make things a little warm after an hour. But if you're sitting at the bus stop in this humid heat, your ears are gonna sweat. At least these headphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the bus and the other people at the bus stop who won't stop talking about Sammy and why he took off. You don't need to hear that story again. Poor Sammy.The ANC (not the chain of movie theaters) is good. For headphones at this price, the noise cancelling is excellent. So I guess that means the noise cancelling is excellent. At this price. These aren't high end Bose, dum-dum. These will remove a lot of exterior sound like a droning fan, dogs barking, a baby crying, a spouse asking you to do something, a police officer telling you that you can't lie here, a drive through operator asking you want you want over and over and over.I haven't tried these on a plane yet. But I will. If I say I'll come back and update this review after using them on a plane, that would feel disengenuous, because we both know that's not going to happen. I feel like there is a modicum of trust and intimacy established at this point, and I don't want to harm that. So let's just agree to disagree, OK? I bet these will be great on a plane.Sound is really really good. I won't say excellent because you might like artificially enhanced Beats-like bass response, and if you do, trying to explain what ""subjective"" means will take too long. I'm kidding. If you really like a bunch of bass, that doesn't mean you are stupid. I don't think calling someone stupid is OK. You just have terrible taste and judgment and probably only give 40% effort at everything.These sound clear and crisp. Bass response is good without being overbearing. (for those who really like heavy bass, that has nothing to do with bears).Sound is great. Really great. Way better than those earbuds you've been using that start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes. Go on, take the plunge. I promise you will happy with your purchase and grateful to me and then we can be friends. You will love these headphones. Later, you will learn to love me.I can tell you are losing interest. I know that look. I'll wrap this up. Buy these headphones. You won't be disappointed. Get a cheap hard case. I found one on Amazon for around $9. Now you have noise cancelling g headphones that sound great, fit great, last a very long time on a single charge, and you'll invest way under $100 all in. You will be the envy of your friends.

RKHKXMSIWHYZW,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect, and better than the newer versions",Amazon Customer,4,"TL;DR -- these are the best noise canceling headphones, and they perform at or above the level of more expensive headphones. I tried the newer Q30 version and switched back to these Q20s due to the better performance.I bought these about a year ago, and I've loved them. The noise cancellation is excellent--my sister was showing me the noise cancellation on her new AirPods Max and it was comparable these Q20s. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of noise, so the noise canceling feature was the most important to me when selecting headphones. I use these to block out my husband watching TV, dogs barking, neighbors blasting music in my apartment building, people talking loudly on airplanes, etc. They are excellent, and I can wear them for several hours before my ears start to get a little sore. The battery life on the headphones is also really good. I'm not a huge audiophile so I can't really tell you if the sound quality is as good as more expensive headphones, but I have no complaints about the sound when I'm listening to music.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that I can only connect to one device at a time. If I'm using them for my laptop and I get a call on my phone, I can't take the call on my headset without manually switching the bluetooth connection over. This bothered me enough to try the newer Q30 headphones, which can connect to two devices simultaneously and also have a little feature that switches from noise cancellation mode to transparency mode when you tap the right earphone. After a couple weeks of trying them out, I am returning the Q30s and going back to my Q20s. The newer headphones had less effective noise cancellation, and I would occasionally get a sharp piercing sound in my ear through the headphones that was a little painful. Some of this could be the shape of my ears or whatever, but I found the Q20s to be more comfortable with better noise cancellation, and a much better price point. I can live with the minor inconvenience of the single bluetooth connection in exchange for better noise cancelation.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AEYVMYSZVTBHXNPGVOTMJ5G3JRTQ,True,88,Color: Blue

Used these the first time the other day when my wife called, she said I sounded clear and she could barely hear my car, the audio on my end was even better so again I can't stress enough how awesome these headset are.

R1FHD65JDCCMGU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G. (for the price),Giblet Gravey,5,"Just got these, but had to say they really sound AWESOME! These provide the best sound I've ever heard via streaming Apple music, and that is compared with my Audio-Technica hard-wired M50s and my Beats Studio Buds (and some cheaper headphones/ear-buds). I'm also comparing this with a good $200 DAC and high-end Bluetooth loudspeakers (or again the M50s).With default settings (ANC on, no EQ) there was a noise-floor and too much bass. The ANC defaults to on, so the first thing I do is turn that OFF (...every time I turn-on the headphones...). I have no use for ANC, and find any ANC does ""funny things"" to my ears, even ignoring the noise-floor.Next, I'm using Apple music, lossless, so my source material is good. Then, I use Boom 3D and my Android phone. I use Boom 3D pretty much everywhere, since I often like compression for those podcasts or movies with volume ""all over the place"", but that's just Windows. Here, with these headphones on Android, Boom 3D is limited to the basic functions (EQ, and a bit of DSP effects). Anyway, after using Boom 3D's EQ to dial-down the bass (BTW, the bass-boost on the headphones is INSANE: not for me, and BTW I'm a bass-player), I was SHOCKED how good these headphones sounded!S H O C K E D !Hey, they are still $60 headphones (not the strongest build-quality, ANC has to be turned-off every time), but for the price (...and I got them on sale...), I am VERY happy.I realize not everyone uses Boom 3D (worth a try, BTW), but I do suggest having some EQ handy to dial-down the bass, or otherwise tune these to your preferences. The mids and highs are there, but these are definitely bass-heavy by default.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2024",AHUBR44TJTI4UC2DE6ZLDA4C7WIA,True,0,Color: Black

Sound is great I don’t have much comparison to other tho. However, I have tried the beats and this are definitely lightweight which is something I was looking forward since I always get headaches specially if putting stuff in my head. So far when I used them for a couple hours it hasn’t happened tho be aware I think the most amount I used them have been 4 hours maybe. I used them when I’m cooking or cleaning too since the duration of the battery is so long which is a plus. For music and audiobooks are great. If you want something cheaper I’ll go for this ones. Another thing I love is that when I turn them on it tells me if my battery is high or low which literally thanks for reminding me.

At first I put the headphones on and played some hip hop to see how the depth of bass and crispness of the mids and highs are and I thought it sounded GREAT... but wasn't blown away. These are not expensive so it was exactly what I thought it would be BUT..... I finally read the manual and there's a button you click 2 times. I clicked it 2 times and IMMEDIATELY smiled. The clear deep bass coming from this little headset is amazing! Even at 100% volume up, its crystal clear and absolutely no distortion at all. I feel like I have a pair or JBLs or Beats on. It's a no brainer on buying these. I'm going to order 3 more for my kids. They tried them on and they LOVE them. They always lose the little expensive earbuds. Can't lose these. The only thing I would wish better would be... the placement of buttons. When you fold them up, the power button on the left ear touches the right ear and turns on every time! If you don't notice this, it will be constantly on. Even so, it really won't matter because they must have alien technology because the battery life on these mamajammaz are absolutely insane.

I am happy with this purchase.However, there are two things that I don't like about this headphone that could've been very very easy to fix:The off button is moody - almost every time, i have to double check that it actually turned off the headphones, because many times, pressing & holding it for 3 seconds (like the manual says) does absolutely nothing.Second, the USB port is USB Micro, rather than USB C. This is the only new device I bought in the last few years that uses USB Micro, and whenever I need to charge it I need to scramble for my one usb mini cable. While USB C I have everywhere, since that's the standard.Sound-wise, the headphones deliver pleasantly colored sound - these are not studio monitors, they prettify what you hear, and for me that's a good thing. The noise cancellation is soft, if that's the most important feature for you, look elsewhere. For me it's ok, reduces ambient noise but doesn't feel like a vacuum.Overall, 3 stars generally and 1 additional star for the great price.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AHLUTP5Z23FAXPIWTWVMJF7ZJZEA,True,10,Color: Black

They fit quite good with one exception - I wish they could be snugger. When I lay on a weight bench or bend over for specific exercises, they start to slide forward/back. Given the quality of the sound and cancellation I can live with this. And considering the price which is perfect.Note about every 10 minutes the music momentarily stops (1 second). I don't care about that.Very good buy.Update 17 June - the fit has significantly loosened to the point they start sliding off when I look up or down.

Way better than other headphones I have tried in the same price range $40-60. This is my third set of Soundcore products. I have been pretty happy with each of them, which is why I was comfortable going a bit beyond my initial budget.The noise canceling works great and has the option of being turned off. It's amazing to feel the sense of silence that the active noise canceling creates. Great for sensory processing, even when using this feature without music or a movie.The on/off/connected sounds and voice are pleasant and the volume for these can be adjusted independent of the headset volume. No loud annoying voice breaking my ear drum to let me know it's on, or the battery is low.Sound is crisp and clear with good mid tones and bass. I have only used these for watching movies so far but they seem to have a good range and I can actually hear background noises in films that I hadn't been able to pick up on before. The listening experience is pleasant and encompassing.I took one phone call so far and I could hear the other person well. They seemed to hear me fine. I did not ask for their feedback so I'm unsure of the sound quality in that regard.The control buttons are easy to understand and use and the headset itself is adjustable and comfortable. I do have a small head so every full headset like this is always just a fraction too large, but with this set it doesn't hurt my head or ears. I have piercings and the soft ear cups do not irritate them.Only downside is that the charging port is for a micro-usb, but that is just a minor inconvenience.So far the charge lasts me a few days with some pretty heavy use, including leaving them on when I pause a show and get caught up doing something else.Easy to connect via Bluetooth. I have not tried these line-in yet.Good purchase, even at normal price. I usually put a lot of effort researching different products to find affordable items that are still good quality.

R32JVWLNA6ETSJ,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable bang-for-buck,JK,4,"I grabbed these while on a trip; I have an old pair of Sony XM3 noise cancelling headphones I normally use on the plane, but since my wife was using them for her own trip, it left me needing something for the 5 hour flight. Grabbed these since the price was right and I could get them from Amazon overnight.I wasn't expecting them to be as good as my Sonys, but they did surprise me, ESPECIALLY at their price point. These things punch well above their price.-Noise Cancelling: not as good as the XM3s, but enough to dull the engine roar and passenger chatter, which was all I was expecting. 4 stars here, as I'm not sure you'd get a better ANC experience without spending 3x as much.-Sound Quality: very impressed, for the price. A little muddy in the mids/highs, but these aren't audiophile headphones. Bass was fantastic (regardless of price).-Comfort/Build: on the cheap side (but they're under $50, so well within expectations). 5 hours on the plane with no issues, plenty of battery life remaining. I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I struggle finding headphones that don't squeeze my melon - these were completely fine.If you have $50 and need some decent BT headphones, get these. Don't buy them specifically for the ANC, but it's a nice bonus to have at this price point. Fantastic general-use/flight headphones, and I'll be keeping them as spares for flights.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2024",AHP7OAQSTTGHTRO6TZU7WVTAFB4A,True,2,Color: Black

My other headphones of a different brand went out today after about a year of heavy use and I needed something urgent because I love listening to music. It came 80% charged so that was great. I'll see how long 80% will last me.I was surprised how good the noise cancellation was because on other headphones on Amazon I saw reviews saying it's not really noise cancelling, but these are the real deal. I was frying chicken while listening to them and when I took them off for a second I was surprised how loud the grease was even though I was standing right in front of it the whole time. Tbh I don't really notice a big difference between the noise cancellation being on and off. But it's no big deal.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it's a little warm therefore making my ears a little sweaty. I can imagine it will be more sweaty in the summer.

No ANC, no ambient mode, no app, no hard case, no aptx or ldac, just aac and sbc. But the audio is excellent. Three equalization modes to choose from, vocal, equilibrium and heavy bass. Heavy bass works well for most contemporary music with that classic v-shaped equalization curve, plenty of bass and treble without muddying up the mids. Battery life seems long enough so that I haven’t ever had to worry about it. No active noise cancellation so don’t expect them to block external noise, they won’t. Earpads are soft but will start to get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours but I think most headphones do. Plastics feel kind of cheap but are holding up just fine.

R1ZH2KG8D6LFSQ,B0B7S1CY8J,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent quality overall, but wired mode isn't balanced and they're uncomfortable for extended periods",Raine S.,4,"* Update (2024-05-17) *Well, they lasted long enough, I guess. A couple of months ago, one of the hinge points between one of the ear cups and the band must've become a little loose, so sometimes, in my bag, the cup would come dislodged, even when in its pouch. Nothing I couldn't fix just by snapping it back in place. Well, fast-forward to just a couple of days ago, where I had the headphones in my bag (not with the pouch, as I unfortunately lost it recently) for an evening away from home, and by the time I got back, one of the ear cup hinges broke. Thankfully it wasn't one that the internal wiring runs through, and the unit somehow hasn't lost any functionality, but the build's just a little more touchy now. I could probably glue it back together, but it'd be difficult to do while maintaining the hinge movement, as a bit of the hinge chipped off and is now floating in my bag somewhere. If I decide not to, at least I got a solid 20 months out of them, not bad for the price. But I guess the build quality comments from my original review may have been a little too optimistic.Also, here are some thoughts on the things I didn't get to comment on in the original review. The unit does passively block some noise, which is to be expected for over-ear, closed-back headphones. Nowhere near standard earmuffs, though, so you still can hear what's around you if you keep the volume down. The battery life is fine; not sure that it's quite 90 hours, but it'll still last you through several days of large use before requiring a charge. Charging is pretty quick, too; it's not even three hours of downtime before it's already up to full. Onboard controls are fine as well, easy to get the hang of. But the microphone…oh dear. It's honestly kind of bad. The other person can hear you if you articulate well, otherwise good luck having a fluent conversation with the built-in mic.Sooo, I wouldn't recommend these headphones quite as emphatically as I did before. But I mean, at the current list price of US$27, they're still pretty good, at least if you treat them well.Oh, one more thing, a fun fact: the official website has had little to no change between when I got these and when I'm updating this review. And nowhere there do they mention the Life series of headphones; only the Vogue 5 and 9 and Care 1 and 3. I don't think they're maintaining it all that much; here on Amazon is the better place to see their current product line, including the other types of products they make (like…ice cube trays. Wild.)* Original Review (2022-09-12) *I received these headphones in the mail a couple of days ago, and overall, I'm happy with the product. The sound quality is fine, the unit feels well-built, it charges with USB Type-C instead of Micro-B, and it has quite a few extra features for the price. I haven't played around with Bluetooth much (I'm mostly a wired listener), so I don't know what the battery life is like, how effectively the controls work, or what the mic sounds like. I also haven't had to deal with noise cancellation, but I imagine that being over-ear, closed-back headphones means it can block outside noise pretty well. This review might get an update down the line if/when I get more acquainted with these headphones, provided I remember to come back.These headphones are not perfect, though. The glaring flaw is actually in the unit's wired mode: it defaults to Heavy Bass mode, and there's no way that I know of to shift it to a more balanced tone without an external EQ. I figured this out by playing Cadence of Hyrule with my ""desktop"" headphones, then listening to its (excellent) soundtrack with these and noticing that the bass is much heavier. To make sure the unit's idea of ""balanced"" isn't actually bass-heavy, I reconnected the headphones, but via Bluetooth for EQ control. Sure enough, the Heavy Bass mode sounds like wired, and the Balanced mode is closer to my expectations. I wish I could change that, as I don't care much for heavy bass, but the on-board EQ doesn't work in wired mode.This is a bit more of a nitpick, but I also think the headphones are a little uncomfortable. I might just not be used to over-ear, closed-back headphones (my ""desktop"" headphones are over-ear, semi-open-back, and my previous ""portable"" headphones were on-ear, closed-back), but they give a sort of vacuum effect that I sometimes feel when wearing ear protection. Not only that, but the area surrounding my ears definitely feels something pressing on it. If the ear pads were removable or replaceable, I could install some velour pads and make it a little better. Point is, it's hard for me to wear these for extended periods. Hey, that might encourage me to take them off once in a while.I think both of the problems I raised are largely personal, and your experience with these may vary. If you really like bass, you might find the wired mode great. If you are used to over-ear, closed-back headphones, these would probably feel fine. Besides the issues I presented, I'm generally pleased with the sound clarity, the build quality, and all the extra features that these headphones provide for the price tag. If you're looking for new headphones and these seem like something you'd use, then give them a try!","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2022",AGYQNZSGZVM2M6QXP4IBNRLHKDAA,True,33,Color: Black
R1WSVDHUH83AGF,B0B7S1CY8J,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for my commute to work/school,cadie,5,"These headphones are perfect for what I needed them for. I was looking for something that was comfortable to wear, and has a great sound. And these fit my needs exactly.They are labeled as soundproof, which I believe they are, but as someone who wears glasses, they are *mostly* soundproof, personally.I ordered these after I borrowed my brother's for work one day, and I loved them so much I had to get my own pair.They fold at two points and fit perfectly in any bag I have with me for the day. They also have an AMAZING battery life. I've had these for over a year and they've been perfect.The band that goes over your head does have a foam cushion and they are very comfortable. I personally can't wear them for very long (context - I wear adult sized glasses and they are too big, they pop out a lot), but they aren't uncomfortable at all.The charging port is just a regular c charger, so I frequently use my phone charger to charge them, but they do come with a charging cord and carry bag.I don't have anything to say about how long it usually takes to charge them, as I usually charge them overnight, but when the battery gets pretty low - around 10% - the light next to the charging port turns from its usual blue/white to red, and a low battery message plays when there's audio playing.Overall, amazing product. 100/10 would recommend for its sound quality, battery life, and affordable price.

Even though my phone charger has the same connector, headphones won't charge with it. Need to plug the cord into laptop for it to charge headphones. I will say the battery life is amazing once charged. There is a small amount of padding on headband. Not enough to make the weight of the headphones bearable if you want to wear them for an extended period of time.While they do fold up, there is no flexibility in the band. Ear coverings have good padding, but surrounding noise comes through. If I'm listening to something I don't want to have to turn them up to the loudest setting in hopes of not having to hear sounds from nearby devices playing. Hard plastic connecting ear coverings to band broke and pulled out cords from inside. I guess if you divide the price by the 12 months they lasted, the price isn't bad. But if you have to replace them every year it's going to add up.I think it's a matter of what you're going to be using them for as to whether they will make you happy or not. Love the battery life, sound is good, and love the color. But they give pain across the top of your head, don't block out surrounding noise, and cords are cheap. Oh, and I have an LG OLED tv.

RZ2VQS6WRD4VX,B0B7S1CY8J,4.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive comfortable basic headphones.,Brenda,4,"I bought these for one purpose: watching tv. We have two tv sets in adjacent rooms, and my wife and I like different programming. Unfortunately, her television projects the sound towards me (while mine projects the sound AWAY from her). When she has her volume up high enough for comfortable listening, it interferes with what I'm trying to watch. I do have ear buds, but wanted some over-the-ear headphones that would block out ambient sounds without needing active noise suppression technology.These phones seem to fit the bill, so I figured 20 bucks was a safe bet. They are NOT noise cancelling, you're relying on the design to passively shut out exterior sounds. Sound is pretty good, certainly they work well for dialogue. The ""normal"" eq setting works best for this. There is a bass boost setting, which I'd probably use for music, and what they call ""HD"" setting, which boosts the higher frequencies, which is essentially useless in my opinion.The good: the price. They are a disposable set of headphones that will likely work well for certain things: working out, yardwork, or (like me) watching tv at moderate levels. Not really a high end set for music. No noticeable latency issues, which can be hugely annoying. I have issues with that using some of my earbuds, where the sound and video become out of sync. I have noticed NONE of that, at least not yet.As of this review, there is an upgraded version. I'd probably go that way if I were buying again (Bluetooth 5.3 instead of 5.0).","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AHDXT7ZJFKMPX24TDDDU6YBXNULA,True,8,Color: Black

Let me tell you something, I only leave reviews when I’m either really upset about a product or really impressed. This one is the latter. I’ve had them for over a year now and I feel like I can give a very reliable review.I love these headphones. I’ve had many bluetooth headphones over the years and they were all pretty meh. Didn’t know what to expect with these but hoped for the best. Like everyone else is saying it’s great on battery. I never need to charge these but I do just so I’m not in trouble. I used to use them wired with my laptop but the aux cord that it came with was short and pretty flimsy so it died about a month or two ago so I finally had to connect via Bluetooth to my laptop and I’m impressed that it works for both sound and audio this way! It also stays connected to my laptop and my phone at the same time. The thing about this though is if I’m listening to music on my phone and I get an email alert on my laptop the music on my phone stops playing to play the alert sound from my laptop so keep that in mind. Another issue is there is a delay for phone conversations and video calls and that’s kinda awkward when you think your sound isn’t being delivered but it turns out there is just a delay. Also sometimes when I’m having a phone conversation the audio just switches to regular almost like the headphones disconnected and so you think the call dropped but it hasn’t it’s just that your phone is now the headset.I would say for the price these are worth the buy. I’m thinking of buying a pair I can just leave at work and keep the current ones I have for home.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2024",AF5DWG7M4XIOM4DNICNYWGQLWTWA,True,19,Color: Black

The sound quality is very nice for this price point. The description says they are “noise reducing.” I’m not quite sure what that means. With no music playing I could faintly hear my mom talking outside on the porch - and she does not speak very loudly. With the music playing, the music is all I can hear - which is good enough for me. The bass setting is clear and not overpowering. There is no had case so I had to spend another $13.99 to get one because traveling with the little bag that they came in will never work.If you have any experience at all with bluetooth technology, installation is a breeze - just like adding any bluetooth device to your phone or computer.Overall I am super pleased with this purchase.

R1J1Z0MI8VOHEN,B0B7S1CY8J,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent low budget friendly Over-the-Ear headphones,E. Moll,4,"These headphones are decent. They have good sound quality but not great sound quality. The battery life on the 3 pairs I own are more then adequate to get through the entire work week on one charge and have had no issues pertaining to battery life. They are not good for people with big heads as they do not have enough extension in the ear pieces to fit comfortably, but over time they seem to slowly stretch out to ""fit better"".The build quality is where I feel needs some advancement and reinforcement. With the larger head shape you tend to see cracks in the plastic at the ear cup pieces and it does not last long after that before they are completely cracked through and falling apart. I think they need some additional engineering design where they look at ways to get better quality, high impact plastic that can withstand the everyday use.The padding around the earpiece is more then adequate for those that DO NOT like having the speaker sitting on the ear like I find with all my Sony headphones that tend to make ears sore.I live in my headphones both at work and at home, I charge them 2X a week because of that extended use. And I really do mean I live in them. They do breathe well, they have some minor flaws in sound cutting out for a blink but I blame a lot of that on the number of Bluetooth connections running throughout the room as this tends to happen more at home then in the office where most things are Bluetooth for the wife and kids with wireless speakers, headphones, computers and televisions.I listen to audiobooks 95% of the time and don't have any issues with sound quality, the music that I listen to tends to be rock and I enjoy the sound quality but it isn't Sony or Beats quality, it gets the job done. As for the noise cancelling, they aren't true noise cancelling but they do drown out the majority of the outside world. I work in an old industrial building that has nothing but huge open overhead space with 6 indoor a/c and heating units that run continuously and can be very annoying to listen to all day long and these drown out about 70% of that non stop loud humming noise, so I find these to be well worth it.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2022",AFQBZQSBF7RYHD4RETA6ZYX4PAXA,True,18,Color: Black

For listening to music and phone calls, these work very well.And now for that I don't like. It's a shorter list! Main reason I got these was I didn't want to deal with a cord while online gaming. And they do that very well. But they don't do 3D sounds very well at all. When enemies are nearby and you're trying to listen for what direction to be facing, these failed to have me even close to the correct direction every time. Sure I heard them just fine! I just could never tell if they were on the right, left, higher, lower, straight ahead or directly behind me. Even after checking to make sure I had them on the correct ears.

R1Z4Y9SGAPOMPA,B0B7S1CY8J,"5.0 out of 5 stars Clear sound, good controls, a bit tight for prolonged wear",emma2u,5,"Sound is very clear for understanding speech from TV. The controls are tiny, as others have said, but easy enough to identify by feel while the headphones are being worn. The power on/off button takes 2 seconds to respond, and gives audio confirmation. The volume up/down buttons raise or lower the volume in substantial steps, so that usually one or two presses gives the desired change. Also, if you hold them down, you go to full or zero volume quickly. When you hit maximum volume, there is a confirming beep at a nice volume (unlike another brand I have where the beep is painfully loud). The earcups put significant pressure on your ears making the unit somewhat uncomfortable to wear for prolonged periods. However, the advantage of the tight squeeze is that the unit does not fall off when you look down or move around. (I have a different brand that is more comfortable, but it falls off your head easily.) The connection via bluetooth is quick and reliable. All in all, I am very happy with this headset.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024",AERA5RSR5XGPV5M6ZAO47UBBIM5A,True,1,Color: Purple

But please keep in mind that your head and my head are not the same. Super easy to connect to the Bluetooth on my phone and on my PC, lightweight, overall very pleased. 9/10 would recommend.I couldn’t tell much of a difference between the 3 EQ modes but for my friends that care about the “Heavy Bass EQ Mode”, I tested it to A Milli by Lil Wayne and gave it a 7.5/10. Which I feel is a pretty high rating for the price paid.My only con is the buttons.. they feel like flimsy plastic covers that’ll break if I press too hard.

I was tired of my AirPods falling out at the gym or dying while I was working out because I'm a dodo bird that forgets to charge them. These headphones were reasonably priced and got decent reviews so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did!Just a few things:1. I have no idea if the sound quality matches the AirPods Max. I listen to audiobooks on the treadmill and music while lifting and have no issues at all.2. They are somewhat noise canceling--better than regular AirPods, but definitely not 100% as I can still hear a bit of background noise in the gym. However, if someone is speaking to me, I cannot hear them at all. I've learned the hard way twice now.3. The audio does leak, meaning my headphone-less treadmill neighbor might hear a spoiler as I listen to Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban but hopefully they've already seen the movie. In reality, though, most people at the gym are either listening to music of their own or grunting and dropping weights so loud that they probably haven't even noticed me.4. They do make my face sweat a lot more so I try to wipe the actual pads down with a disinfectant wipe when I'm done working out.All in all, I'm super happy I bought them and I love the color. I'm hoping these last me a while but I'd probably buy a second pair even if they broke.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2023",AEFY2D4IZJSZIJFUTZBINTL4TISQ,True,36,Color: Purple

If I need a pair on my head for many hours at a time, it's hard to explain how but the Life3's have felt more comfortable.

The sound quality no longer has the richness and clarity I've come to expect, and the material used for the song-switching buttons feels cheaper and less durable. Additionally, there's a noticeable ""Made in China"" marking on the headphones, which was absent in my previous pairs. This change raises concerns about the overall craftsmanship and quality control.

The 7's stay in your ears like they are glued to them (I use them while hitting a heavy bag) and the features and functions make them awesome.I spend a lot of time on my desktop phone making and receiving calls for business, so I always use a good headset. I was thinking about getting a set of Bose and almost did and then thought, ""I wonder if Tozo makes a good set"". That's when I found these HT2's.I am incredibly happy with them! They are every bit as good as a set of Bose Quiet Comfort (yes, I have used them so the haters can stop now) with excellent bass, great highs and mids and are INCREDIBLY comfortable. I can wear them for 8 hours and pretty much not know they are there. They also work great with Desktop (Windows 11). Long lasting battery, too. The mic on this headset is very good too and has excellent noise cancelling capability.The most important thing I can say about TOZO is that when you have a problem, the company is all over it.

After days of indecisiveness whether to buy this ones or another brand, I ended up buying this TOZO HT2 headphones model. Both headphones were very similar in terms of functions, reviews and stats, so the only reason I ended up with this ones was their bright dark red color.It arrived later than expected due to a mail carrier mistake, but they arrived in excellent conditions.Connectivity is good. They can be very far from my phone and the sound still won't get lost or glitch. I can even connect my phone and laptop at the same time with Bluetooth, which is nice.In terms of ANC functionality, they're everything I wanted. I am autistic, and I'm pretty hypersensitive towards loud noises, so they've helped me being around noisy environments without having to cover my ears (and look rude while I do it).It has 6 different options for noisecancelling once you download the app and connect it through there. I still don't know how to use half of them but it's the kind of things that would take me some time to figure out.The color is super pretty. I bought the dark red ones because the ones that said only red were a bit orangish in the pictures, so I was afraid of having super dark red, almost maroon colored headphones. Fortunately, my headphones turned out to be this very beautiful cherry red, which is nice, since I already have lots of things that color in my wardrobe.Durability is good too. I've only used them for a week, but so far they've been exposed to running, yoga, and workout exercises, as well as a walk in the rainy weather. So far, so good. I was afraid they would fall out my small, female head easily with movement, but it has stayed in its place. They're very comfortable and I can keep them in my ears for hours. It's also a nice detail that they have ""Left"" and ""Right"" marked inside of them, so I can know easily which side am I putting it on each ear.I still need to try them for a lot more time so I can have an actual opinion on them, but at the moment, I'm very happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AHQGHT2FUCDATYFRW4N2C3EO7A6A,True,25,Color: Dark-Red
RG0Z4BDWZ4BBI,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding value for the price!,Amazon Customer,5,"The Tozo HT2 is a great, budget-friendly headphone/headset! At the time I got them, they were $50 with a $10 off coupon, so I figured I’d give them a try since I’ve had prior experience with Tozo products—specifically, the T10 Bluetooth earbuds. If you’re curious, I still use the T10 earbuds everyday for running, working out, and walking my dog. But as expected, the HT2 is another fantastic product made by Tozo.I’ve had these headphones for exactly a week now and can say that I am more than impressed by their quality! The first thing that you will notice is the packaging. It is very sleek and modern. Inside the box, you’ll find the headphones, a quick instructions guide, a slightly more in-depth instructional pamphlet, some promotional material for their App and warranty, a ~2-foot USB-C cable, and a ~3-4 foot aux cable with 1/8th inch ends. The HT2 feels like it is made of pretty good quality plastic. The speakers are marked “L” and “R” for easy identification and are surrounded by comfy foam. The right speaker has four buttons, including the power button, a connected + and – button for controlling the volume (I’m counting these as two separate buttons), and a noise-canceling (NC) button.Holding the power button for about three seconds will turn the headphones on/off. Syncing the headphones was incredibly fast and easy. In mere seconds, I was listening to music. I ended up downloading the Tozo App, which allows you to play with the settings so you can customize things like the bass, mid-tones, and treble.The first time messing with the settings, I couldn’t tell if it was affecting the sound. Turns out, I had to update it. Here is one of the few cons of the HT2, updating the headphones through the App took about 10 minutes, which is fine. However, upon clicking on the “Update” tab, it doesn’t give you a warning pop-up or anything, it just starts updating, and during that time, you have to keep the headphones and phone powered on. The App says not to exit from it while it is updating either, so for about 10 minutes, I had to stare at a loading screen while worrying about whether my phone would go into sleep mode if I wasn’t constantly tapping at it. However, since the update, the headphones respond to the customization settings. Speaking of which, the customization settings are pretty in-depth and have about 10 points where you can articulate to your preference. I typically just use the default settings, but I can see people getting into it and editing their settings for specific types of music. But let’s get into the HT2’s sound quality and use case scenarios!The HT2 has great mid and treble tones but seems to be lacking in bass. That being said, I think the sound quality is truly outstanding. I listen to an eclectic range of music and found these headphones doing each genre justice. You can pick out and hear every instrument of a song, and vocals are crisp. These headphones are also good for podcasts as well. I’ve probably put around 25 hours of listening time with these and haven’t noticed anything weird regarding crackling, noise interference, disconnects, etc. I’ve also only charged these twice; the battery is pretty incredible, though I’d imagine it will degrade over time. Currently though, pretty good. The range is also good. I can go anywhere within my apartment (not big, about 850 square feet) and stay connected, even with doors closed/in other rooms. The Noise-Canceling function is pretty good, though it won’t block out loud noises completely, just muffles them. That being said, it made functions like vacuuming and using my food processor less noisy (for me at least lol). I did find them capable of blocking out moderate noises, such as office banter at work. The Noise-Canceling button switches from Noise-Canceling (default), to off, to something called “Pass Through” which I’m not entirely sure what it does, but it seems like it allows noise from outside to be hearable, whereas turning the NC off just seems like you have earmuffs on and can dully hear noise from outside. Since I am on the subject of the Noise-Canceling function for these headphones, I will say that the button placement is kind of weird. When looking at the right speaker head-on, the NC button is at around the 4 o’clock position. The first few times taking the headphones off, I found myself accidentally pressing the button. Eventually, I changed the placement of my fingers when taking them off to avoid this. However, the NC button is very sensitive and doesn’t take much force to activate/change the setting. For example, just taking off the headphones and laying it on a flat surface will often press the button in. This can be jarring when putting the headphones back on after having them off briefly, but not long enough to warrant shutting them off completely. Another minor con I found with these headphones is that they suffer from sound leakage/bleeding. This means that when in use, whatever you’re listening to can be heard from outside. Apparently, this is common for overhead headphones (not earbuds), so that’s why I find this to be a minor issue. That being said, if you work with others in a quiet setting, you might want to either listen at a lower volume or use other headphones/earbuds.So besides listening to music/podcasts/stuff, what else can these things do? Although I’ve only had them for a week, I was able to do some unconventional testing. These headphones act as a headset and have a built-in mic. Turns out, the mic works pretty well. I didn’t use these to make a phonecall, but I tested them by syncing to my laptop to do video meetings for work. I didn’t hear any mentions of them sounding bad or cutting out. The audio from meetings was good too, no echoing, or disturbances that you may get with lesser-quality headsets.Another thing that I tried with these (though I don’t recommend) is audio editing. I used these to edit some sound files through Adobe Audition 2024 and noticed a lot of latency. Granted, this is a problem that affects most Bluetooth headsets. That being said, since these headphones come with an Aux and USB-C cable, I’m sure I could have used either to connect directly to my computer and eliminate that latency.Something cool I decided to do with these headphones is to use the Aux cable to jack into a quarter (¼) inch adapter and into my old Line 6 Spider IV 15-watt practice amp. Turns out, it actually worked! The sound wasn’t that great, but I only spent about five minutes messing around. I was more curious to see if it would work. I’m sure if I put in some time, I could have made it sound better though. Maybe something worth updating on later.One thing that I haven’t been able to do with these (that will also warrant touching upon in a later update) is using these for gaming. The reason being is that I have a PS5 and apparently it requires an adapter/dongle to use Bluetooth devices.To wrap things up, the Tozo HT2 headphones are surprisingly high-quality for a low cost. The sound quality is excellent, though it lacks heavy bass—if that is important to you. The battery life is also really good. Though I didn’t touch upon it, wearing these headphones for longer periods is pretty comfortable. Typically, I find headphones to squeeze/hurt my ears after about an hour, but I’ve been able to keep these on for around four hours before I felt I needed to take them off. The Aux and USB-C cables allow you to directly connect to sources, allowing for flexibility and opening new doors for using these headphones. Though these headphones have some minor drawbacks (NC button sensitivity, weird/long App/headphone updating process, and sound leakage/bleeding), the overall value you get from the HT2s is more than worth the price.12/30/23 - UpdateI used the AUX cable to connect the headphones directly to my PS5 controller and they work great! Especially nice when my downstairs neighbor's dogs are barking nonstop. With that being said, I don't play multiplayer games, so I can't tell you how well the microphone works online or if it defaults to the microphone built into the controller.5/3/2024A little late, but I regularly use these with Audition 2024 for audio editing via the AUX cable that it comes with. Unlike with the Bluetooth setting, directly wiring to the computer (PC in this case) reduces audio latency. An added bonus is that using a direct connection with the AUX cable does not use any battery. Not sure if that is common knowledge for most people, but it was something I didn't know. On a related note, the battery for these are still great, and despite me using these pretty frequently, only warrant charging about once every two weeks or so.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AFFFUP7Q4BSGFJJNTTKY36D5QDTA,True,54,Color: Black
R1VI8JY6X7T7NK,B07KY8G9NM,"5.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight, Comfortable, Good Sound, Easy Controls, Quality ANC",3kpagesperyear,5,"These are great over-the-ear headphones--a big improvement over my Cowin set. I like these for a bunch of reasons:1. They weight only 8 ounces (Cowin weighs 9 oz, which is 12% heavier, which makes a big difference when you're wearing them for an extended period of time such as watching a movie)2. The ear padding and head pad are really soft and comfortable--nicer than my Cowin set.3. The ANC (noise-cancelling) is very good and comfortable. What I like about the TOZO (both these headphones and the earbuds) is that when ANC is on and I'm not listening to anything (it's quiet) I do NOT get a nauseous feeling--especially when I turn my head. With my Cowin and most other ANC headphones I have tried, I get a queasy feeling when I turn the ANC on and have no audio playing and it gets worse when I turn my head--a bit like vertigo. So, these TOZO's are a vast improvement for me not to have that vertigo/nausea!4. They talk to you. The headphones have a pleasant voice and tones that tell you what you're doing with the controls and connecting up on Bluetooth. It plays a tone when you turn them on or off. It makes another tone when it's looking for a Bluetooth source to connect to. It makes a 3rd tone when it connects and syncs with a device, and then sound starts playing (if the device is playing audio). It tells you what ANC mode you are in: ""ANC On"", ""ANC Off"", ""Pass Through"" (Pass Through mode is where the headphones slightly amplify the sound on the external microphone to make it almost like you're not wearing the headphones). That said, I think I like how the earbuds work better than the headphones in this regard, as the earbuds say ""Power On/Off"", ""Pairing"", and ""Connected"" instead of using tones, so it's easier to understand what the earbuds are doing.5. The controls are straightforward. There is an on/off button (with a raised ""O"" on it for ease of finding it with your fingers without having to take the headphones off and look at the buttons to see what they do), volume control (with a raised ""+"" and recessed ""-"" where the ""+"" is on the upper side of that button and the ""-"" is on the lower side of the button--versus the Cowin where the volume up button was on the lower side of the button and the volume down button was on the upper side of the button), and a button for cycling through the ANC modes.6. A big complaint I have had with headphones for decades was having to figure out which side was left and right. All of them had a tiny L or R located somewhere on each earpiece, but they were ALL difficult to see because they were always small and were the same color as the earpiece--and especially hard to see the L or R in low lighting. These TOZO have a *large* L and R inside each earpiece making it really easy to know which side is which. See the attached picture. There is also the standard tiny L and R on the hinge point for each earpiece, both those are also difficult to see and thus not as useful as the large L and R inside the earpieces.7. I like how the headphones fold up pretty flat and are not as bulky to store as those headphones that don't fold up. See the attached picture.8. The sound is good. I've watched a few movies and TV shows and the stereo separation is very good, the sound is clean and crisp.9. The ANC works well in damping out exterior sounds, and it is easy to tell the difference between the 3 ANC modes with these headphones.I also tried using these headphones to make a call on my cellphone. It worked okay but not great. The audio on the call was good, but I was told by my callee that the microphone pickup was staticky and somewhat weak and I made the call from inside the house with no other noise. Also, it just 'felt' weird listening to myself when I spoke as it felt to me like my voice was a bit disembodied. So, while we could do the call, it seems the earbuds are a better choice for making calls than the headphones. This is a really minor nit to pick, since I can't really imagine people would be walking around making calls with these headphones on anyway.My experience with TOZO support has been very good--certainly superior to most other companies. They respond to queries quickly and clearly. They are interested in addressing your concerns and making you a happy (and hopefully repeat) customer.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AHE7TDZKCBZXORD4D57Z73FPIEVA,True,16,Color: Blue
R1LVP2M7954J04,B07KY8G9NM,4.0 out of 5 stars PLEASE FIX THE EQ APP!!!,Nicole,4,"These headphones are comfy and adorable. Definitely work for small heads—make take a period of stretching for larger heads. ANC is not ironclad—but they’re also $40-$50, so if that’s what you were wanting, you probably need to look at something else, haha. They are good enough for my purposes, so at least if there are louder noises, they are muffled (ex. being on a plane, you will still hear that “plane noise,” but it’s much more tolerable). Love that they can be folded up, I got the headphone case by Hermitshell specifically for TOZO HT2 (wish they offered colors other than black, but who knows later down the line). I once tried Bose QC35 II, and those unnerved me for how fragile everything felt. I wouldn’t go throwing around the HT2 or roughly handling it either, but I’m definitely less worried.Here is my primary qualm:THE EQ APP NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. You can create your EQ settings by adjusting the sliders in different frequencies to whatever decibel you wish, but if you move one button, you will every easily move other ones next to it (like 95% of the time). Even when I tried using a stylus, it was very difficult. Please fix the touch sensitivity/range on this. I feel if you grab one slider and move up and down, it should not affect whatever other ones your finger may brush on.I would also like it if you could see what decibel setting you had sliders on (so like,-2.3, +1.5), in case we want to make note or share EQ settings with friends (seeing the numbers change as we drag the sliders would be a nice extra). I also think it would be very helpful if you could hear the sound changes WHILE you’re moving the slider, instead of only after you let go of it. Anker is able to manage this with their speaker EQ apps, so I would hope TOZO could figure it out too.The other issue l've had is when trying to adjust EQs, my hand has accidentally brushed one of the presets on the lower part of the screen and the app switches me to that EQ, so I lose any progress I was making on a custom one. It would be better if when we made custom EQs, it took us to a separate screen so there was no accidental switching in the middle of making one.I left this same information on a review of the app, so hopefully TOZO takes note eventually. 😭FYI, the blue may be slightly darker in person, but still a nice color. The other pair I have shown is the purple, which I am sending back, because unfortunately it is significantly paler, to the point where you can barely tell it’s purple.Also FYI—I believe they’re adding a dark red color soon, because it’s showing as an option on the box, so I will likely be getting that later and giving my blue pair to a friend who enjoyed them.UPDATE 5/4/23:Don’t worry, I’m not here to tell you they broke or stopped working or anything because that is not the case, haha. I will say however:- App still needs the improvements I mentioned in the original review.- I see that the dark red HT2’s are out now.- FYI Hermitshell now does offer more case colors for the HT2.- I got the Soundcore Life Q35’s (I read reviews comparing it to newer ones like Q45 or Space One and apparently newer is NOT always better), which unfortunately clearly sound better than the HT2 (without having to make custom EQs). To be fair, the Soundcores are double the price of this (also if you do look at those, the pause detection may work at first but is highly unreliable), but there’s just so much more clarity with the SL Q35’s (their pre-set Piano EQ is miraculously good for everything?? which is feedback I’ve heard from others as well) that I can’t bring myself to reach for these very much. I desperately wish I had the sound of the SL Q35’s (set to their piano EQ) in the body of the HT2’s. The Soundcore ones feel less sturdy, they’re not as cushy, and just don’t fit as well overall. I also like the look a lot less than I do for TOZO HT2.So, Tozo, if you’re reading reviews, please a) seriously update the EQ app, and b) consider aiming for an HT model that sounds like the Soundcore Life Q35 (to their piano EQ settings!), but still basically had the body of the HT2. Please? I know I can’t really ask for super specific things, but I still wanted to throw it out there! If they had sound quality like that (and an improved app), the HT2 would be perfect to me (good pause detecting or touching the side to pause wouldn’t hurt either—I’m not as concerned about ANC quality).","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AEV7GSNZBFKLBNHPDCP2FFATLHGQ,True,31,Color: Blue
R1P6ZDY3Z7WTJ6,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommend the Tozo Bluetooth headphones,ufodriver,5,"My Bose quiet comfort II headphones shorted out on the left earphone after 2 years of great (solid) service. They were the expensive ones, not the budget set. I picked up the Tozo set, based on great looking reviews, and the nearly disposable price point of $40 ! C’mon you gotta love that! I just needed them to last and provide phone usage when driving (professionally) and provide minimal entertainment usage. Well friends, I’m not exaggerating to say I’m blown away by the quality, and I’m not going to spend hundreds of dollars on Bluetooth headphones again as long as I can get these! First the couple of negative comments: The charging light is in dire need of improvement unless you’re in a blackout room. But in sunlight cupping hands around it to see if it’s lit up & charging - forget about it! You can’t see it! 2nd Unlike more costly headphones these give no vocal status about the battery level. In fact it’s a guessing game, as there’s nothing that tells you the battery level whatsoever. Okay now the positive stuff:Everyone I’ve spoken to on the phone over these headphones has been impressed. The phone call clarity is better than any other headphones or purpose made hands free headsets on the market period. I’m a professional driver (trucker) you can trust me on this, we go through the available headsets trying to find a decent one, like chefs go through knives, and these Tozo headphones are Fantastic in this area!!! The music quality is superb as well, with good bass. The noise cancellation can be turned on/off. And it isn’t as strong as noise cancellation on the Bose, but it is adequate even in a noisy truck going down the road - which is saying something. In fact I think it’s a bit weaker on purpose, because stronger noise cancellation pressurizes the ears, causing fatigue after having them on all day. If you are reading reviews to find a good solid headphone set, do yourself a favor and try these for 40 bucks. Do not be fooled into thinking that for $200 to $500 that you’re going to get that much more in value for you money. You may have more acute hearing than me, and disagree on the sound quality when listening to music. Regardless I’m absolutely certain that you will get much more than $40 return on value out of these!","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AEZ3PGQSG2IMGXS4QVQQNLWMIMBA,True,5,Color: khaki
RFZX66PQWWR4W,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply Amazed by these TOZO Noise Cancelling Headphones in Airplane Environment,Techkie,5,"I purchased these TOZO HT2 noise cancelling headphones as i was traveling abroad and need to cancel the background noise while on the plane. These fit the bill perfectly as not only does the noise cancelling feature work but the sound to cost ratio is amazing. They are also loud enough where you will have zero issues listening to an audio book or movie on a plane. I was so impressed I bought another set for my wife.These headphones can connect via Bluetooth as well as traditional wire which is included in the box. In addition, they also have a built in microphone which allow you to have phone conversations. I was surprised by this feature as the description doesn't mention this capability.Noise cancelling works wonderfully. You have a noise cancelling button that enables, disables or sets the headphones to a passthrough mode. Every time you press the button you hear ""Noise Cancelling On"" , ""Noise Cancelling Off"" or ""Passthrough"". Again, you can clearly tell the difference when Noise Cancelling is on as most of the background noise is blocked. This also help with ears popping.The other great feature is battery life. I used these for my entire trip abroad - to and from, and never needed to recharge them . In addition I have used them for over 20+ hours without ever needing to charge them.Finally, in testing the built in microphone I was able to place calls and have conversations without issues.Overall one of my best buys this year.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHOBMMOIKIJN2FOWZ6VXVJBOXPJQ,True,0,Color: Black
R2S8EVKGOWYYA2,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommend,Jesseca Cunningham,5,"I was skeptical of all the raving reviews but I gotta say, I get it. I will say my prior headphones were Sony bass boosters that were about the same price as these; I’ve never had the super high end ones.But here’s all my pros:- Large ear pads are comfy enough to be unnoticeable and wear for many hours while working/doing homework.- Connect easily to multiple devices.- On-ear controls plus an app- Excellent sound with variable settings. R&B is my favorite and feels richer than even the bass+.- Battery lasts for days and weeks…literally.- Gives warning warble when low battery—then charges fully in about an hour.- The transparency and noise cancellation settings are both great. No complaints.- They fold up multiple directions for storage.Cons- There is a tiny bit of lag when watching videos- Sometimes you have to turn off the Bluetooth on the device you’re not using to get it to connect. Not seamless.- You can’t view the actual battery level unless you’re connected to the device you have the app on. My Sony’s you could press a button and it would verbally tell you your battery level, so you knew to charge before it was dying.For the price and quality, I’m totally good with the cons.

Clark,5,"I've flown over 2M miles in my life and been using my Sony Noise Cancelling headphones for the last 10+ years. They have worked really well, but it was time for a tech refresh. I purchased this headset because I have come to know and trust the Tozo brand and this didn't disappoint! After turning these on, it paired easily with my iPhone and then I did a test in the car (normally I don't drive with noise cancelling for safety reasons...) and was amazed at how quiet things were. I couldn't hear the engine start or the AC blowing. Even when I drove down the road, there was no background car noise. My daughter called while I was out and I spoke to her and asked about the sound quality--she said it was really loud. Considering that the Sony wasn't very good in this department I was really pleased. I'm also now considering using these for work--I spend a lot of time on Zoom calls. Well worth the price--I'd put these up against other premium noise cancelling headphones like the much touted Bose.

R19IM78ZEAVRRW,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for auditory sensory sensitivities,kds,5,"I bought these because I am very sensitive to sound sensory. It took me a while to buy a pair, and I was afraid to spend this much on them because I had no idea if they'd work for me. I knew that other types, such as for gun shooting, are too tight on my head and give me headaches.After reading the reviews, I decided to take the plunge and buy them. I know they're way less expensive than others, but it's just a lot of money if they don't work.So, these are incredible. They do help take the edge off all the sounds in my home, thus giving me a better sensory experience. Sometimes I use them with my loop earbuds in also, and this really helps.They are also great for listening to music, talking on the phone, and doing virtual client sessions.These are great for professionals needing some sound canceling at a decent price. They are also great for people with auditory sensory concerns. They are easy to use, simple to pair with devices, and have Loooooong battery life. They connect well, and I can walk a decent distance from my devices and still use them. One thing that did surprise me is that when they are lugged in wo the computer with the cord, the power doesn't turn on, so that's interesting.

They are well constructed and don't feel cheap, will be cool if you could fold these up like others but not a huge deal. The Lowe's hit pretty hard the mids could be a little better in the highs are mediocre I'd say. The out of the box sound is pretty middle of the road although the lows are pretty heavy.

Of course, I didn’t want to get my hopes up since the adjustment from earbuds to over-the-head headphones can be a weird shift, but as soon as I went to test these headphones on Spotify, I was hooked. Going from 5 Spotify songs to a few YouTube videos and fiddling around with Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Reduce Wind Noise, Leisure Mode, Normal Mode, and Adaptive Mode. Although I still have to adjust to some of the headphone controls and keep myself from accidentally switching off noise cancellation, these headphones are definitely worth the money if you want great audio quality, a comfortable fit on the head (if you have a large head or big ears, trust that these are for you as well), and a nice durable feel—nothing too flimsy.

At the smallest setting the headband was sitting about an inch above my head, but not for my husband.They lack depth unless you adjust the equalizer in the app. The app adjusts the headphones directly - you don’t have to be using them on that phone. I had them connected to my PC via Bluetooth and when I adjusted the equalizer in the iPhone app, the headphones immediately changed. Downloading the app is a must if you want the best sound quality.Sound quality is really good - although the highs seem a tiny bit muddy, the lows and bass is great.Noise cancelling is good - when turned on it blocks ~90% of the outside noise although you can hear a slight hiss. That hiss gets much louder when in Pass Thru mode - where it lets in ~50% of the outside noise. With music playing, the hiss fades.The 3.5mm analog audio cable is a good length at just under 5ft. I wish the charging cable was as long - it's only about 3ft so I can’t charge the headphones and use them at the same time since my PC is ~4ft away.Impressive battery life - I used them w/ ANC turned on for 5 days of an online conference that was 6h+ a day before they died.When connected to my PC I could only go ~6ft away before the sound broke up, but that’s a fault of the BT v2.0 on my PC. When connected to my phone that has BT v5.3 I can get more than 50ft across the house and maintain great sound, even through walls. If you have an issue with distance it’s probably your connected device, not the earphones.The L/R printed in the muff seemed cheesy at first – but now I think it’s a fantastic touch by an inspired designer. Always putting them on the right way ensures the volume button is exactly where you think it will be – all wireless headphones should have this.Overall very impressed – but that’s what I’ve come to expect from Tozo. These HT2’s are lightweight, have solid sound, pretty good noise cancellation and great battery life – great value for the money!","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AEE5ZWXVIUI5YAF5MNASUDVXFGFQ,True,16,Color: Black

Especially noticeable watching lips and and singular object impact sounds.I know for a fact it's the HT2's since i have several BT headphones and even a TOZO on-ear and in-ear devices and they do not have as much lag.Made sure all enhancements are off. Tried updating windows drivers, they are current. Tried removing and re-pairing. Turned off Hands-free service. Nothing help.There is an audio/video sync test on you tube... it emmits a ""clack"" sound along with a bouncing ball and a scale that read ""0"" directly under it with minus milliseconds on the scale to the left and plus miliseconds on the right... i can clearly see the ball bounce off the upper bar on the scale, then rebound ""before"" the clack sound. Each indicator line on the scale is 100ms... the clack sound occurs at allmost 200ms. Other headsets, buds and on-ear buds clack at around 50-100ms.I have a powerful BT radio attached to 3.1 USB port. HT2's have BT 5.3 protocal, so they shouldn't have 200ms of lag...

I have had better for the same price,Brian from the Boro,4,"I have a lot of headphones and earbuds, wired and unwired, I have Bose 35 and Beats (which I hate) and I bought these so I could go wireless on my computer. I have a set of Sony MDR-V600s that are wired and fantastic but I wanted to go wireless so I can walk around the room.I think the sound quality is really good for the price. The Noise Cancellation is too. The bass is enough and with noise cancellation should be more than adequate.This also has a built in microphone to use with Zoom or Teams or Skype or whatever conference calling you use. I like that feature and it works well.I like how they feel on my head. Good ones can be worn for hours without ear pain. These are good that way.I like how when Windows recognizes these on bluetooth, it will remember them. If I want to use my hard wire headphones, no issue. When I turn on these headphones they pair up and take over from the wired ones. Great.So why the overall rating of 4 stars. The issue I have is like a DJ I once was, I tend to pull off one ear at times and the button for noise cancellation, transparancey, etc is exactly where you would reach your right hand to the earcuff and adjust it. And then the voice says, Noise Canel off, Transparency, On... etc...

RY2SSDWUILEQZ,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great value budget headphones that sound expensive!!,JBrown,5,"The TOZO HT2 headphones are surprisingly competent and come at an affordable price point. Let’s dive into the details:Design and Build Quality:-The budget-friendly price is evident in the design, which is functional but not overly stylish. I like the simple look, no flashy badging or unnecessary accents. I did notice other cool colors were available but I stuck with the black.The earpads are made of soft pleather, providing comfort during extended use.The one drawback for me was the size. I have a smaller head and I felt the headphones would sit a little below my ear even on the smallest setting. This also caused the headphones to almost feel a little too big and slosh around. I usually wear a hat which made them fit my head better, not a deal breaker. I am not planning on using these for running or workouts.Sound Quality:-The audio quality is impressive for headphones in this price range.While it benefits from some EQ adjustments, the sound remains natural overall. The TOZO app provides some fun EQ settings which are easily changed.The 40MM dynamic drivers provide good bass. However, like most ANC headphones, you lose that deep rich bass unless you keep ANC on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):-The hybrid ANC algorithm, along with three ANC microphones, delivers effective noise cancellation.I was poking around in the TOZO app and found a ""reduce wind noise"" setting. I was using these on an evening walk with a slight breeze. I am not sure if it seemed different from the normal ANC mode but it seemed to help. For my use, I will pretty much always use the ANC mode on.Battery Life:The TOZO HT2 offers a remarkable battery life of 60 hours per charge, so they say...I can't confirm that but I have used these for a few hours over a few days on a single charge and still have 80%. I can say they have excellent battery life. These will be perfect for long listening sessions or travel as they are light weight.Additional Features:-The headphones come with a companion app, allowing customization through a custom equalizer, as I mentioned above.Transparency mode lets you stay aware of your surroundings when needed.Cons:-The size as I explained earlier but I do have a smaller than average head. This may not be a problem for you. This was probably my biggest con.Unfortunately, there’s no carrying pouch included in the box but given the price and quality of the headphones, I am glad they didn't cheap out on quality to fit a case into this price point.Call quality during phone conversations may be underwhelming.In summary, the TOZO HT2 headphones are an excellent value for the price. If you’re looking for budget-friendly headphones with good sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and comfort, the HT2 is worth considering. TOZO seems to have a lot of coupons for these headphones which makes these hard to pass up!","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024",AEC3DFHF25F7TMCVNNZJUGWNTSXQ,True,7,Color: Black
R2VZWME00DSCOP,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than some of the top headphones,Chris,5,"I am writing this as a direct comparison to Bose 700’s and Beats Studio’s and the comfortability, material quality, and sound/EQ quality is absolutely unmatched. It comes with over 10 EQ presets on the app but you can directly customize and modify any of them however you like and the ANC is also far more customizable. Only thing even remotely comparable in that regard is maybe my pro airpods but even then I would say this is equal if not better. You can make it to where it just eliminates wind, all noise, or a couple variations of transparency mode is also an option and I think (as someone who has tinnitus and really bad hearing) I can actually hear talking and things around me far better than most over ear headphones I have used with transparency on. I have only had them for about 2 weeks and not had crazy heavy usage so I can’t 150% vouch for the durability or longevity of them, but quite frankly when the headphones are 60$ or less I’m not quite as worried about that as I would be buying 400-500$ ones. Tozo’s in ear buds are extremely good too and I would highly recommend the Tonal Dots if you are looking for in-ear and not over.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AEQFP6ENHXBSCUXIL3KJZEXFSM7Q,True,0,Color: Black

I must preface this by mentioning that I do not have a professional audio ear so my expectations might be different from someone who knows more about higher end sound with headphones.I currently own a pair of the Tozo brand ear buds and use them almost daily for audiobooks, podcasts, listening to music at work etc. I am extremely happy with them and think the sound quality is great. I really appreciate the battery life of them too. I had such a great experience when I asked Tozo some troubleshooting questions and was impressed with the customer service of this company.When I was looking for something for use at home to listen to my tv without disturbing others in the home, I looked at Tozo options first. I was pleased to see that they have an over the ear type of headphones and have great reviews, and a great price point.So far, I appreciate the size and comfort of the headphones. I find that the sound quality is definitely up to my standards for normal use watching tv. I got the purple color and really like the look and feel of them. I assume that the battery life will be comparable to the earbuds that I own and if otherwise I will update this review. The earphones are easy to pair with bluetooth to my phone and my tv.I recommend these headphones and Tozo in general if you are looking at products with a company/brand that stands behind their products.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2024",AFKAHKVPES6CZUS4DC4DMUKT5ICA,True,2,Color: Purple

Sure, you could do Beatz(I think, for 3 X the money,- and they are great, (a friend let me try his), but for what I do, they will surely work for now and perhaps for longer.

No dread of a incoming predator like I previously felt as soon as the rails started to rattle. These improved my quality of life greatly and I highly recommend them.

Nearby voices come through thin and tinny and faint, unless you switch to transparent mode, where it actually amplifies exterior sound so you can hear the world around you. Great for awareness.They are a little flimsy, so if you treat gear rough they aren't for you, but at the price they are pretty unbeatable. (Oops - pun.)

R1Q65D6CANA70C,B07KY8G9NM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound, less than declared battery life",SWU,4,"Just got this Tozo HT2 for three days and continuously tested its sound quality and battery. I will say that its sound quality via Bluetooth is excellent, although a little less so than the Bose QuietComfort I also have, which, of course, is much more expensive. When connected with the 3.5 mm cable, however, its power automatically turns off, hence no more ANC function, but the wired sound quality is still good enough. Tozo's battery life, however, surprisingly falls far short of the 40 hrs with ANC on as the company claims. I charged it in full and tested it several times after each full charge, and the battery life dropped to 90% after one and a half hours of watching a YouTube movie. So by calculation, its battery should be depleted in 15 hours. Bose QuietComfort, on the other hand, claims to have 24 hours of battery life. I have used it intermittently for an hour and its battery life still remained 100%. Bose's battery quality is apparently better than Tozo's. I give Tozo 4 stars for this reason. One mystery is how Tozo will fare on an airplane when it must be connected to the seat's TV screen by cable. Will there be noise cancellation when its power is turned off? Doesn't seem technically possible.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AFSIMXKCZV2R5EDYEEQ6QG47ASUA,True,0,Color: Black
R1R7O8R40S6DFZ,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive for 40 bucks,S. Abney,5,"I always like playing with headphones. My Skullcandy's broke. The power button when straight into the headphones and they were only 2 years old. Did I like them yes, worth the money, no if you compare the ANC 2 abilities. I purchased a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4, they are nice, that app works well. Overall sound quality and adjustments, good. Volume level, pretty good, not going to blast your ears too much which can cause damage, but overall, good sound. So, let's bring in the Tozo HT2. You ask why buy these because you have the Sony, they are almost a $300 pair of headphones? The Sony app only allows connectivity to two devices even if I don't have them not connected to my iPad or my iPhone, they will not sync to the MAC. Stupid Huh? That is a Sony app issue because the way the work, bluetooth to the phone/iPad and then sync'd to the Sony app. It's s double sync, I thought so too. Bluetooth wouldn't even pick them up on the MAC because of it. Here comes in the Tozo. I wanted an in expensive pair to work with my MAC for work meetings. I installed the app on my iPhone and my MAC so I could have EQ. iPhone, the app works just fine. MAC, doesn't see the headphones so I can EQ them, but is picked up via Bluetooth, so I can use them on the MAC. Not really a huge issue since it's just used for Voice. Sound quality is good. the ANC isn't as good as the Sony but not that far off to be honest, but I will say this....the sound quality of the Tozo up against the Sony, you can't tell a difference that much and the volume level on the Tozo is a little more than the Sony. EQ these things out just like the Sony and you wouldn't be able to tell the big of a difference in quality of sound. Sony is just a little crisper, but I bet if I keep tweaking the EQ, it would go away. Most people wouldn't even notice to be honest. Wish I would have found these before the Sony. I would just have bought two pairs in two colors. One for work, one for personal use. So, let's talk about comfort compared ,, the Tozo are more comfortable to me because of the earpieces. Put the Tozo side by side to the Sony and the look almost identical. I've had the Sony for a hot minute so I cannot return them or I would and just go buy another pair of these. For $40 very surprised. It just goes to show you, that if you have an app and the product is good in itself, some of these products do compare to a $300 pair for way less.

The volume wasent as hi as the AirPods but I myself didn’t mind sacrificing for sound quality. Plus the AirPods randomly fall out of my ear. If your a heavy sweater you may as well just take them out. Didn’t have to worry about that with the TOZO’s. And when the air pods dropped so many times it will damage it.

I wouldn't recommend getting these headphones to workout, because when you sweat they easily fall off, so I just use my earbuds. The app is ok. The UI isn't the best, but I guess I'm just spoiled from the beats app. I wish it came with a case, but overall a good product if you're balling on a budget.

They very comfy, and i use them all the time around the apartment for late night when listening to podcasts, music, and even movies. They have the most minimal look, and have the most colors available. My only problems are that the noise cancellation is de activated when using the 3.5 cable, which is a bummer when using on planes, and the not so airtight noise cancellation.

R8V1JVJU3QP7J,B07KY8G9NM,4.0 out of 5 stars Great performance for fair price,BRYON SCOTT,4,"Disclaimer: TOZO gifted these headphones to me. Even so, the following comments are without bias.Build: The phones appear to be well built. The headband adjusts with a clicks that feel solid yet unforced. They sport a sleek and clean look.Comfortability: My previous set of headphones were Logitech H600s. Compared to those, the TOZO unit is larger and heavier. However, the fit is much better and the larger earpads make for a vastly superior feel. I have a smaller head, and the phones fit snuggly, which I like. I'm not sure how comfortable they would be on a larger dome.Sound quality: I am not an audiophile, but I do enjoy good sound quality. If there is anything that bugs me, it's tinny sound. These phone do not suffer from that malady. The bass is warm and solid and the highs are crystal. The sound is several factors better than the H600 headset. In this area, these phones far outperformed my expectations.Microphone: The phones have a built-in microphone that is adequate for communication, but not for professional recording. Audio from the mic sounds a bit like you're in a cave. To be honest, not much can be expected from a mic in any headphone, however.Latency: There is absolutely no noticeable latency in these phones. I am beyond impressed.Noise Canceling / App: I was completely surprised when I discovered the TOZO app and linked them up to the phones. The app provides six noise-canceling modes that work beautifully. I have dogs that bark from time to time and I can clearly tell when their racket is being canceled out. Change the mode and ambient sound is mixed in with my content. Further, once the device is added to the app, you can change modes even when the phones are paired to a different device. Simply brilliant.Other notes: I have not used the headphones long enough to drain the battery yet, so I have no real data on how long a single charge lasts. I have listened for over four hours, however, and had more than 50% charge left at that point. Also, I have only had these for a little more than a week. Sometimes the performance and durability of electronic devices degrades over time. I plan to update the review after several months of use.Overall value: The purchase price of $39 is right in the range of similar headphones on Amazon.

Upon receiving them, the ""white"" color resembled more of a khaki tone, which was not what I expected based on the product images. This discrepancy extended to the charging cable as well, which also appeared khaki instead of white.Despite this color issue, the headphones perform well in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation. The audio clarity is impressive, delivering rich bass and clear highs, making them suitable for a variety of music genres and even for watching movies.

I wasn’t anticipating anything as good as this product for the price it is, but it has exceeded my expectations.The noise canceling so far seems to be just as good as the ones I just threw out. To me, that’s a big thing as I have to take a lot of trains and this cuts out the noise beautifully. I feel that these are possibly even better than the $300 ones in terms of this feature.The EQ adjustment is easy and you can do a lot. Bass is very important to me, and I haven’t played with the settings enough to see if I can turn it super high, but the bass boost option has been sufficient but not amazing.The app that you can download as a companion to these headphones is the main reason I bought this pair instead of others with good reviews at a similar price. The pair of Sony headphones I had also had an app where EQ can be adjusted and whatnot, and the TOZO app is comparable, if not better. It certainly has more features.The sound quality is fantastic in my opinion, I was immediately shocked when I listened to music with these for the first time. It’s very crisp, occasionally a little too crisp if that makes sense, but I feel that it could easily be fixed by adjusting the treble or something. If the production of a song is really good it feels like surround sound; which is also very cool for the price point. Seriously, for around $40 these are an absolutely steal and I don’t find myself even missing the $300 pair yet. I never write reviews but I feel like y’all should know.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AHKUD6LAWYRQOPC7BM5IYH3NRM3A,True,3,Color: Black
R26RJQ08811SND,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars ✈️🎧,obk,5,"I travel a lot, and always bring a pair of ANC headphones on a plane with me. I went through a number of those already, because they take a lot of abuse over time. My last pair is already aging, so I couldn't pass this deal from TOZO.Pros out of the box+ Obviously, the price+ Metal hoop, folding design, good for compact storage+ large over the ears cups, completely cover my medium size ears. The foam is not as soft as on my other headphones, but very comfortable. I wore those for 3h straight so far, sleeping on a plane -- no issues, no soreness+ ANC works very decently. These things went a long way since a few years ago, so it seems even less expensive models perform quite nice these days.+ Supported by the TOZO app, and I had two firmware update since I bought it. Nice to know the vendor cares about their products.Cons sre my personal:- Seems like an incomplete kit. This product is clearly designed for travel but it comes without a travel case and no two-prong adapter is included, which are still needed on some airlines. Probably too much to ask for the price, but would be a nice touch. Luckily, I had a spare adapter to use, and a generic case from Amazon fits the HT2 just right.- controls are far from perfect: all the buttons have the same profile, without any distinct features and it's difficult to tell which one is which, often confusing NC button with play/pause and other button- NC mode requires turning on the headphones and pairing. You cannot simply use them for noise isolation. My other headphones have a simple hardware toggle switch to quickly turn on and off. Also NC button always cycles through thee modes, and I find the ""transparent mode"" to be unnecessary.- voice announcements are in English but with thick asian accent. Comprehensive, but surprising in 2023...None of these issues being critical, this product is still a very good deal for the price, so I'm keeping it.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023",AH7G7E25GDWN2CQM7BLWMSPOBPNA,True,6,Color: Black
R19ZVQA32APQCL,B07KY8G9NM,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, comfortable, so-so ANC",Jerry Hoffmeister,5,"My initial impression when I put these on was that the ear cups were a bit small for my ears and they sounded good but the base was a bit punchy / pronounced. After wearing them for awhile, I decided that although my ears touched the sides they cups are quite cushy and surprisingly comfortable. I can wear these for hours without discomfort. I also decided that I liked the sound and wore them for several hours enjoying music and listening to a podcast that day.I'm going to compare the sound and ANC quality to several other headphones / earbuds that I own - Bose QC II earbuds, TOZO Golden X1 earbuds and Sennheiser Momentum 3 headphones.I had no problem getting them paired to my phone and connected in the TOZO app. On first connection to the app, it found a firmware update and that got installed with out issue. This is what I expect but there are other products (notably the Bose QC IIs) that bluetooth and app connections can be an issue.The controls are intuitive and easy to use. I've found this to be true with all of the TOZO products that I've tried.Sound quality: I like listening to them. The highs are crips and the base is punchy with out being muddy. I notice that compared to my Sennheiser's especially, the HT2s sound a but closed in - the Sennheiser's and the Bose both feel more expansive - have a wider soundstage. The HT2s have a wider soundstage than the Golden X1s tho. This is kinda expected tho - both the QC II and the Momentum 3's cost 5-6 times more than the HT2s. Excellent sound for the price.ANC: I found the HT2's ANC to be just OK. They perform similarly to my Momentum 3's. I tested using fan noise - a bathroom fan as well as a speaker playing music. The QC IIs are the gold standard here - they almost completely blocked out the fan noise as well as the music. The Momentum 3s and the HT2s blocked maybe 1/2 of the fan noise. I noticed that they both blocked almost all of the lower frequency fan noise but let thru the higher frequencies. The performance using music was similar - again lower frequencies were attenuated more than high ones. The Golden X1s ANC was marginally worse in both categories although similar. Bose generally wins this contest.Pass thru mode: Again the Bose performed the best but I was quite happy with the pass thru mode for the HT2s. I could easily carry on a conversation in pass thru mode without taking them off of my head.Similar to music, the HT2s were very similar to the Momentum 3's and slightly better than the Golden X1s.Bottom line - these are definitely worth the asking price. Good sound, comfortable, OK ANC and good pass thru mode.","Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023",AH6P4RCHZJF6JZVNSAUL3HOWAH7Q,True,60,Color: Black

RWHCU9BO4U6CF,B07KY8G9NM,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, a little uncomfortable with glasses",Joseph,5,"I have used other Tozo earphones in the past which were quite good, and these did not disappoint. I'm not an audiophile, and these will probably not compare to $500 dollar headphones, but they do sound good.The noise isolation (passive blocking of sound just from wearing the headphones) is good, and paired with the active noise cancellation it is sufficient for blocking out constant noise such as when in a car. It has a ""pass through"" mode which allows you to hear things going on around you, which can be a very useful feature, especially when you need to be able to hear your surroundings for safety reasons. It is a little louder than I would like, but I have sensitive ears.Battery life is good, though I couldn't say exactly how long it will last, because I have not had it run out. The box says 56 hours of play time, and I have no reason to doubt that. (That is probably with noise canceling turned off, but even with noise canceling you should be okay for a long day of listening.)I would like it to be lighter weight, but that is the trade off for long battery life and solid construction.I have them paired with both my tablet and my phone, so when I power them on they connect to both, which is convenient for me. Whichever device I push play on will control the headphones, and I don't have to turn off Bluetooth on one device to get them connected to the other as I have needed to with other wireless headphones.The only real problem I have faced is that the earpieces grip my head quite firmly. That is only a problem because of the earpieces on my glasses, which become uncomfortable after a couple hours of being pressed firmly into my head. My head is on the larger side of average, which doesn't help. Without my glasses it is not a problem, so if you don't wear glasses, have a smaller head, or a shorter use session, that shouldn't be a problem for you.All in all I am quite happy with these headphones. As far as I can tell everything is as advertised, and the (advertised) 40mm drivers sound quite good to my ears.","Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2023",AH5KBTKH6T4OMFJ4DZLMZTW7LLKQ,True,5,Color: Black

I'm taking a long plane trip and wanted to kill the engine noise. These seemed like a good budget option. They fit well and are easy to set up and use - linking to my iphone via btooth was a no-brainer. However, I suspect that there are better noise cancelling options out there if you want to spend more money. These are not terrible, but they're not as quiet as I was hoping. Still, I'll be fine with them, especially for the price.Regarding audio quality, all audio speakers take time to break in, so I don't know how these will fare over the long run, but I can say that the bass is big and upfront. Now, big bass does not necessarily equate with good audio quality - these seem a bit cotton-wooly (high tech term :). Again, for the price, these are not bad; if you want to spend $300-400 on high end stuff, you'll hopefully get the full audiophile experience. Otherwise, these seem like a good buy for the buck, and I have no idea when I'll ever use them again, so I didn't want to go high end.

The bass is especially fantastic and all of this can be adjusted to your own preference using the app.Battery Life - I have yet to run these dry.

As I mentioned I was informed by my gym-going children, these did a great job blocking background gym noise and music… better than the Beats headphones they were using. The transparent mode does a decent job of introducing the ambient sounds and I can hold a conversation with the headphones on provided I stop the music.I have used these for phone calls and there are no complaints for sound quality on the other end.

Fully cover ears - this is great as a glasses wearer. Placement of volume control and power are on the back right ear - it feels really natural and easy to have them placed on the back like this, first time for me. This is also my first time having a pair of noise canceling headphones that are for daily use - my test was if I could hear my dog eating her kibble with the volume low and I could hear when the kibble hit the metal bowl. I could not hear the train when outside. I will provide more details on how the noise canceling feature holds up in an airport. The sound leakage is notable, but you dont need to blast the volume to be able to hear the sound so I dont anticipate this being as much of and issue. The headband does slip a little, but my head is on the smaller side. They stay on, just move a bit if I lean forward. The adjustment features are really nice and intuitive. The ear cuff being able to have free motion to adjust to the shape of your head is something I did not know I needed.Overall, these feel like I great buy. They are sleek and comfortable. Easy to setup. The packaging was shrink wrapped and packaged with protection in mind. I'm really pleased.My old Bohm headphones [extremly uncomfortable but lasted 6 years with frequent use] finally started biting the dust.

R3UORB5OPPIP4I,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Easily worth double what it costs,Celeste,5,"These headphones are great! These were the first over ear headphones I've tried from Tozo, but I've tried both the nc7s, and the nc9s as well. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had high hopes based on my previous experience. These definitely don't disappoint.First off the sound. If you’re an audiophile you won't be disappointed, but you also won't be blown away. You get what you pay for, so you’re not going to get the sound quality you'd get from 400$ bose headphones. I'm not an audiophile, and I was very happy with the sound. The sound could be a little clearer, but it's significantly better than the 60$ headphones I bought before these. I would say the base is average, but with the app you can get a little more base from them if you want. Overall I'd give these 4 stars out of 5 for sound.Second is the noise cancelling/ transparent mode. The noise cancelling isnt the strongest ive tried, but for the price i was very happy. With volume at half I can't hear anything around me, unless someone is screaming or there is a very loud noise close by, and even then its very quiet. When the volume is 25% I can hear some talking, but thats with me trying to hear things. Noise cancelling with no volume isn't about what you'd expect. You can hear talking, or car noises. It's significantly quieter though. Transparent mode, or pass through mode is nice. You can clearly hear things when it's on unless your blasting music. I don't have alot to say about it because I don't use it very often, but it's nice to have when I need it. For the price I'd give these a 5 out 5 stars for this section.Lastly is build quality/ packaging.I was very surprised when I got the box. It's very sleek, and clean. It almost feels like your opening somthing from Apple. I was even more surprised when I opened the box and held the headphones. The build quality is great , and Id honestly compare these to the quality of bose. They feel very nice, and sturdy. It's not light like some 20 dollar ones you'd get, but also not heavy or cumbersome when you wear them for a while. The ear muffs are very soft and comfortable. I could easily wear them for a several hours with no discomfort. As a plus they also come with a charger, and an aux cord if you need it. I'd easily give these a 5 out of 5 stars for this section.Just as a side note, the battery life is better than you'd ever need. The company says you can get uo to 60 hours of battery life from them. I cant say for sure, but Ive had them for 2 days, and using them all day i still have 60% battery left. You really can't go wrong buying from this company. The customer service is very very good. They go above and beyond to make sure you’re happy. One of my tozo nc7s earbuds stopped working within warranty and the company replaced it. So far I've been very happy with every product I've tried from them.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023",AEMLFWXFXCW4EEVD4B355P7C67PA,True,22,Color: Black

Even with that side not working as it should the sound when music is played does sound really good.Battery life is great as well; I can go maybe two days without having to charge it. Connection was very simple and I love that it comes with a cord just in case it does run out of battery life. Would I buy it again or recommend it to anyone?

RLBHLHUKFYN2R,B07KY8G9NM,4.0 out of 5 stars A utilitarian device for a decent price.,Justchillin,4,"It comes packed in a nice sturdy box. No carry case included. The line cable and the usb c charging cable are also included. Quality feels nice. I didn’t use the line in cable which I believe is for when you go on a plane or connect to something that doesn’t have Bluetooth. The plastic that covers the outer part look very “cheesy” but its purpose is to keep the headset from scratching while in transport. Fit and feel is not as nice as let’s say a Bose 700. Can’t adjust the headphone width on the “fly”. I would need to remove the headset off and guess what size I need, adjust the size and put them back on. The around ear foam is somewhat stiff and hard. The ears get noticeably warm after extended usage. The battery life is ok. I get maybe 8-9 hours on a full charge. The noise cancelling works but definitely not as robust as let’s say the Bose 700. The headset connected to both to a Roku, windows 11 PC and Samsung cell phone via Bluetooth without any major issues. I would have to attempt a couple of times to pair the headset with the devices. For the price it’s not a bad unit at all. If I wanted a pair of headsets that I wanted a teenager to use and not worry about them losing or breaking a $300 pair of headsets this would be it. The company was kind enough to ship this unit out to me for free to test.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGRJUVFBJAL2BRW66XEUZBKGJXIA,True,6,Color: Black

R3S5V2XLORIGFW,B07KY8G9NM,5.0 out of 5 stars Expectations exceeded!?,Juice,5,"The Build: These headphones appear to be well built. The headband adjusts with a clicks that feel solid and unforced. They have a sleek and clean look.Comfortability: the TOZO headphones are slightly larger and heavier than my previous headphones. However, the fit is alot better and the larger earpads make for a vastly superior feel. I have a smaller head, and the headphones fit snuggly, which I like. My son has a larger head, and they also for him comfortably.Sound quality: I am not an audiophile by any stretch, but I do enjoy good sound when I'm listening to my music. These headphones do not sound at all tinny, the bass is warm and solid and the highs are crystal clear. The sound is considerably better then my previous headphones.Microphone: The headphones have a built-in microphone that is adequate for communication, but not for professional recording. Audio from the mic sounds a bit like you're in a tunnel, but I really never expect much from aheadphone mic.Noise Canceling / App: I was completely surprised when I discovered the TOZO app and linked them up to the phones. The app provides six noise-canceling modes that work beautifully. I use these to listen to audio books when my kids are watching TV or gaming, the nose cancellation makes it an enjoyable experience for all of us while spending time together in the same room. Change the mode and ambient sound is mixed in with my content, maybe it great for times when I'm walking the dogs and want to hear the traffic. Further, once the device is added to the app, you can change modes even when the phones are paired to a different device.Other notes: I have not used the headphones long enough to drain the battery yet, so I have no real data on how long a single charge lasts. So far I have listened for over 6 hours, and had more than 45% charge left.Delay: Sometimes with Bluetooth devices you notice a delay, it can be really noticeable when you are watching a movie and the person's lips don't align with the sound. I am thrilled to say that their is absolutely no latency with these headphones.Overall these headphones exceeded my expectations! That being said, I do not know how they line up to the competition in quality, but I can't imagine better performance at this price.Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I love having them in pink! Hopefully Tozo will add purple to the available colors of future headphones.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2024",AGIIFFA75PCOPUNZITXE3RY26IJA,True,23,Color: Pink

Had a $300 pair that were incredible, sound, bass and noise cancelling were awesome and the lasted about 8 years before the dog got ahold of them. Second pair were ultra cheap, no name junk. Not enough volume, sound quality was terrible and the noise cancelling was non-existent. These also fell victim to the dog. I bought these because of the reviews and they were cheap. I could not be more impressed. Loud enough to hear every detail of the music over my zero turn's engine and noise cancelling is good but seems to occasionally want to ""recalibrate"" the noise cancelling so you get a little bit of volume fluctuation. The sound is not quite as good as my $300 pair, but they aren't that far off either. Highly recommend these for a cheap option.

However, there are lots of mindless chores, like dishes and vacuuming, that are impossible to do with my earbuds in but that might make those tasks more tolerable. I saw a video where someone was using an expensive brand of noise-cancelling headphones and decided to seek out an affordable alternative on Amazon. These had good reviews, and I liked the blue color, so I ordered a pair and have been using them for the last couple of weeks.Long story short, they are fantastic. I can run the garbage disposal with these things on and barely hear it. I can vacuum while listening to a book and not miss anything. I can just put them on so that my kids think I'm listening to something, and it makes their voices much quieter. :) I'm not exactly sure how long the battery life is, but I've only charged them once, and I use them almost every day, sometimes for hours at a time. They had a good charge straight out of the box, so I was able to use them right away. The buttons are pretty easy to figure out, but a couple of them are oddly placed (for me), so that I hit them when I don't mean to or hit the wrong one. I'm always accidentally turning off the noise cancelling because the button is located right where I grab the headphones to adjust them or put them on.

As others have said, the mic is questionable for online meetings and such, but perfectly fine for phone calls. I needed a headset to wear all day for work because I'm meetings most of the day. I had been using a Plantronics 2-ear, on-the-hear headset with mic, but the quality of music through those is very poor, and they're not super comfortable. I got these after having now 2 sets of TOZO earbuds, that my wife and I love. I think TOZO makes great products at reasonable prices (where they should be honestly). Anyway, I got this headset so I could listen to music while working, without having to alternative between a headset that was good for meetings, and a different one good for music listening. I chose to get an external USB microphone for my audio, instead of using the onboard Headset mic for my computer.IMPORTANT NOTE: If using Windows 10 or 11, and you don't want to use the headset as a phone (mic) device, be sure to disable Windows Telephony on the device, or it will sound terrible, because it uses half the Bluetooth bandwidth for the mic.

RX2Y49IKGNAJN,B09D3MFSGJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Hell Yeah,Rick Stepien,4,"I needed a new pair of cans and was looking at wood ones b/c I thought they looked great. The dark brown coloring meets the look I was going for. It came with two cords and a carrying bag. The sound is extremely crisp. The bass tones are full sounding and I haven't noticed any distortion or cracking when both heavy bass and higher tones are playing at the same time. I tested volume a bit - what I found was they out performed my volume tolerance, playing just as clean and crisp at high and low volumes.Noise cancellation wise the covering on the ear pads do provide some along with the closed back of the speakers. I didn't buy them specifically for NC - so not a big issue. If you need that feature - there might be better options.The headphones themselves feel appropriate weight, not too light or heavy. The speaker portions feel solid and the cups themselves articulate in, out, and rotate to better fit your shaped head. I wear a 7 1/4"" hat and have to have both extended fully out. This does flex the upper strap quite a bit. The upper strap on my old headset failed (it was made of plastic mostly). This headset has a fabric similar to the speakers with I believe a metal strap of some sort inside for the upper strap. I am hopeful it will last longer.The two cords, one was significantly shorter than the other and features a push button control of some sort. It has standard headphone connections on both ends I believe 3.5mm. The other cord (the one I am using) is brown, much longer, and has a coil in it. I was apprehensive but it works really well. That cord has a standard connector on one side and the larger 6.35mm that you can plug into one side of the headphones. It also has a 3.5mm jack on the other side if you use a different cable.Overall great headset for use at my desk.

R375C1F68EHZEU,B09D3MFSGJ,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly IMPRESSED! WOW!,Crusty3g,5,As a professional photographer I am slowly getting into videography and I built my own Cinema rig. I needed a good set of headphones to monitor the audio and I went and bought a cheap pair of $10 headphones that I actually thought got the job done. But after hearing the audio after I started editing I was pretty bummed out on my settings. So I went on YouTube and was looking at best budget Studio wired headphones and these headphones kept coming up in the top five pics over and over. So I decided to give them a try and wow! Like the title says I am truly impressed. I got these headphones for $32 and I'm not a big headphone guy over the ears I mean but I usually use earbuds and I have never heard audio sounds so crisp. It has just the right amount of bass not too much and the sounds is really good. I like how the ear must go over my head and ears and blocks out all the outside noise almost. I've been getting into recording interviews and dialing and the audio with these headphones make it so much easier. Even listening to music it's like I'm sitting in a studio listening to the music being recorded live. I can't even imagine what $200 or $300 pair of headphones like these sound or how much better of the sound would be compared to these. I am really happy with these I don't know how long they'll last but if you expect these the last for many years for $32 you might get a little disappointed but I can't say how long they'll last but if they last for 6 months to a year I've gotten one heck of a deal out of these headphones. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone. They are a fine quality sounding headphones.

R1FIOWNCVRJMLT,B09D3MFSGJ,2.0 out of 5 stars Expensive gaming headset going bad? Replace with this! (Updated),Squidslinger,2,"Not completely replace, depends on the headset you have before and your mic needs. Many gaming headsets have USB sound cards in a small attachment in the cord. I'm speaking from experience with a HyperX Cloud II. Frankly, I love the Cloud II for a lot of reasons. Most important being it's an extremely sturdy design which holds up better than others.When you've had a set disintegrate on your head because of cheap plastic breaking down, you learn what to look for in a proper set. However, the Cloud II suffers the same problem that every wired headset or headphone suffers with time. Damage to the tiny wires inside the cable. When this happens, you are kinda stuck with either buying a whole new set or learning how to solder and repair the set yourself.This is all what happened leading up to my purchase of these OneOdio headphones. Now I do have solder experience but, the right equipment needed to work on the Cloud IIs, I didn't have. When calculating the cost of what I'd need, I estimated potentially maybe $30 worth of tools. Not the ""$2"" quotes a lot of guides online tell you (because they don't need to buy all the equipment). There was also the problem of recognizing where the break in the cable was. Often times these happen near the jack which is easy to fix. However, in my Cloud II, it happened up in the headset itself. Which means a bit more time and work trying to fix.Ultimately opting to get the OneOdios came down to a sale. They were on a sale that put them down into the price range of how much I'd need to fix the Cloud IIs. Given I've got smaller headphones that work just fine from the Cloud II sound card, even deliver the same virtual 7.1 sound, meant to me that the OneOdios would work fine.Now I know, these don't have as good of a Mic as the Cloud II has so why would I give up on the Cloud II? Simple, I had bought a Blue Yeti for my mic usage as I got fed up with how poor much of the headset mics were. I never used my Cloud II's other than testing. So there I had no value on using the Cloud II's. Mic problem had been long solved.Next it came down to the quality of the sound. Would the OneOdio's be just as good? Cloud IIs have 50mm drivers. The OneOdio have 40mm. Smaller but, when I compare the sound quality, they are virtually identical. Really could not tell the difference.So the next major factor which helped decide my OneOdio purchase was the cable setup. These have plugs on the headset and for the audio device. Meaning, if the cable gets a break in it, just swap the cable out, no need to toss the set. If Hyper X or other game headset makers did this, it would be a game changer and would solve another major issue with the sets breaking. However, they make over $100 in some cases on each set and people are often more than willing to buy a new one vs fix or replace. Hyper X won't sell just refurb or renewed headsets because then people would likely realize they could get cheap headsets by just buying the parts individually. So it's a long shot to expect headset makers to do this kind of feature except on expensive sets.Now, where OneOdio loses some points. Simply, the frame is a recipe for breaking. It's plastic. Granted it doesn't feel like cheap plastic but, it's still a weak point. Especially the swivel feature.OneOdio also has the same love of the crappy fake leather that it seems everyone uses. They use it on the head area and on the ear cushions. This stuff is utter crap. I've used it on numerous sets that came with it over the years. It falls apart very quickly. My Cloud II had it and the head cushion strip is almost all exposed and the earpads that had it disintegrated within a few months of use.Then lastly, this is kinda silly but for some reason OneOdio doesn't put a R or L to tell you which channel is which on the headphones, except underneath the clips where you can change out the ear cushions. Come on, there are about 3 or 4 places I can think to put these indicators on the external that wouldn't make the product look bad but for some reason OneOdio puts them in the one place you'll never see. Pretty silly.Ultimately, this is a great headphone. It solves my replacement issue and makes me realize I can get by quite a long time without buying expensive headsets. Some quirks but, for the cost of it, could be worse. There are sets that run over $150 that have more issues than these headphones do. Definitely would buy again if needed.*Update*Well they lasted 6 months before the plastic that allows the headphones to twist and turn decided to break. It's just a simple connection inside the unit. Definitely the weak point. Guess I'm gonna break out the soldering iron and try to patch the innards into the Cloud II after all. Great headphone till now. Lost a star due to poor materials for the definite stress point of the headphone.*UpdateNo response from OneOdio after a week of warranty submission approval. Extended warranty was accepted. OneOdio has not responded. Losing more stars.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2019",AH2WPYALTZSZXWHLOVQIVODLHERA,True,26,Color: Red

The sound quality is definitely better than any headphones I have listened to at this price point. The clarity is good as well, but the volume can best be described as subdued. I purchased these to replace my old pair of Bose noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones whose right speaker recently crapped out. Since I use these exclusively for listening to movies from my receiver hooked up to my AV system (so I don't disturb my wife) they will suffice. However, if and when they do require replacement, I will look at purchasing some other product. As far as build quality fit - they appear pretty solidly built even though they are predominately plastic. The cups are well padded, though a bit on the smaller size. I am a tall person (6'7""), with a corresponding big head, so I need to have the earpieces fully extended. I really like the fact that there are 2 different sized jacks available as my receiver requires the larger jack.Overall I am not completely disappointed, but I am not overjoyed either.","Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2023",AGBFNNCGGFBBJBRRFXTC3YNZSY2A,True,1,Color: Black

R1JYBFY0N9H5VJ,B09D3MFSGJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfy and clear,Dominique Cyprès,4,"The headphones look snazzy, feel nice on my head, and sounds great. I think they're my favorite of any headphones I've ever had. I tend to use them mostly as wired headphones but they work pretty well on Bluetooth as well. My only complaint about the Bluetooth functionality is the controls for seeking forward or backward. Like many Bluetooth headsets, three rely on the volume +/- buttons, but where others headsets use a double-click of these buttons to perform seeks, these require the user to hold one of the volume buttons for what feels like kind of a long time before it seeks, and then it only seeks by one increment until the button is pressed and held again. The headphones shipped with a silky drawstring bag to hold them and two audio cables: a sturdy 6.35mm to 3.5mm cable, TRS on both ends, with a coiled section like an old telephone cable; and a thinner 3.5mm TRS to 3.5mm TRRS cable with a built-in microphone. That first cable works really well and I use it all the time. The 3.5mm end of it has these little metal protrusions at the bar of the sleeve that slot into the 3.5mm port on the headphones; your have to take care to make sure this is fully inserted if you're using the cable to listen to a 6.35mm source, but the sound is clear and the jack stays securely inserted. The other cable, the one with the in-line mic, is a totally different story. The one I got simply doesn't work. I haven't really tested the mic, but the cable simply doesn't get a proper signal into the headphones. I can turn any device up to full volume and all I'll be able to hear through that cable is a barely detectable whisper. I tried my own 3.5mm TRS to 3.5mm TRS cable of another brand in the same configuration and it worked just fine, so I think that cable with the in-line mic really just doesn't work. I've seen similar complaints on the listing for this same cable sold separately by the manufacturer. I wasn't planning to use the mic anyway, though, so I'm not really bothered.All in all, there are a couple little annoyances but most of the time they're a non-issue for me and the headphones are a joy to use.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AENCL2JZPRCWRQJ2M4EKG6W5FMNA,True,5,Color: Silver Brown

My wife gives me crap about it regularly, but the joke is on her, she married me, I digress....These fit my cranium, but only on the largest possible adjustment, but they do fit, and comfortably.The biggest ""want"" that I had for these, was for them to fit over my ear, and what I mean is not that the muffs rest on my ears, but surround my ears. My ears fit within them perfectly. Checked a very important box for me.Another big ""want"" was to be wired with a 1/4"" plug to go into the stereo receiver near my desk to listen to my vinyl collection without driving my family nuts that the old man is blasting old Led Zeppelin albums again... I knew that it came with that plug, but didn't know that two cables were included, and that they're interchangable. You can swap cables on the fly. The cable with the 1/4"" jack is long, and has a coiled portion to stretch out to like 9' if needed. I currently have it going about 3 feet away, and there is plenty of slack. The headphones have both the 1/4"" and standard headphone jack on them, one on each side. The flexibility to use different cables for my different devices was huge to me. This helped me push my rating to 5*Although noise cancelling was advertised, it wasn't that important to me as I would be using these in my home office to listen to vinyl, video games, streaming video, etc... while working or when my kids are sleeping, so I don't really need to block anything out. With that said, there is no active noise cancelling of any kind, and at this price, you shouldn't expect it. The only noise cancelling you get is from the seal that the headphones make around the ear combined with whatever noise is pumping through these, that's it. For most people that would be fine, and in my case it works perfectly. My issue is that when you advertise it and use it as a selling point, you need to be absolutely clear how your product achieves that selling point.For what I listen to, these work out great. They're not going to blow your mind, but they get the job done, and they do it pretty well. I would say that if you're looking for a good set of headphones for casual use, these are good. However if you're like me and want the flexibility to use these with your old school stereo, while being able to use them with your other devices, these are tremendous value.For good sound performance and having the flexibility features that I wanted at this price point, I had to give them 5*.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020",AHZ7ZE3GUIEPRPBB5QJOSZG7GZBQ,True,4,Color: Silver Brown

R183VA8LQ7HPKD,B09D3MFSGJ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones,Tom S.,5,"Ordered these for home use. They are larger than i had expected, but do collapse down into a carry bag, that is included in the purchase. Come with 2 different cord options. Ear pads fully cover listener's ear, which reduces background noise. While these are not actively 'noise cancelling', this fitment does block out some ambient background noise pretty well.Once on your head, there is a little pressure on your ears/side of head, but the padding on the ear pieces does help keep these comfortable.Sounds are clear, delivering the highs and lows quite well. I have used these with a couple different portable MP3 players, and the headphones have been able to take max volume and still maintain sound clarity. Other than for rating purposes, I don't think it would be advisable to utilize these at that volume level for extended time, but these will punish your ear drums if that is something you are looking for.Nothing but good things to say about these after a week of ownership.

I get my tablet out because it's the only thing I've got readily available with a ¼"" TRS jack for headphones. I listen to mainly heavy metal and I also like some EDM of different varieties. They sounded great, as expected. So I had to see if they met other expectations. I got a guitar amplifier out, a small Yamaha practice amp. I also got out my Schecter Damien 8 Platinum with 808Xs. And I played the nastiest riffs into that Yamaha. These little headphones were loud and overwhelming, while being clear and precise to the tone. You couldn't tell a difference between the raw tone coming out of the speaker, and the sound coming from the headphones. The only difference was your atmospheric noise pollution was cancelled out. It's kinda like a personal sound room or studio experienced. These headphones are worth it.

As with most {removable} cables, though, you'll find that rubbing the cable at all makes an enhanced noise (say your arm hits it and rubs it, it amplifies the rubbing sound in your ear). Also, this particular set's cable is a special-fit end, meaning if for whatever reason you lost this cable, I don't know if any ole generic cable would fit in its plug, since the plug has a different shaped edge (it's not round, more like a keyhole shaped edge), but, yeah. they're great.

What I needed and wanted were very solid listening headphones for Music, Movies, Streaming & Gaming. So doing a long lasting research for a few weeks I went with OneOdio wired Red/Black A71.I was not disappointed, The packaging was very welcoming, the use of separate detachable dual 6.35/3.55mm red coiled plug and a dual 3.5mm plug I use for my PS4Pro Controller is a trend setter. The cups and fit is very very comfortable fit.Sound: With 40mm Drivers offer a very solid bass and a very clean balanced sound across all the uses I mentioned above. No tin can type of reverb that I noticed.Build: Well it is $33 bucks, so I did not expect it feel like it was made from pieces of the Berlin wall. It feels just as solid as Sony PS4 Gold wireless but with much greater mobility then add the pillow soft cups and a well padded overhead. I do feel any misuse or mishandling will not be in your favor. Durability wise I don't know yet, as I only had these for a few days. But I'm not a mad man. I like to treat my stuff w/ care and that alone usually works with longevity of my gadgets.Surprises: The 3.55 Mic sound was actually surprisingly good on my ps4pro. I was able to hear others and others were able to hear me. I do wish a Mute toggle was available tho without continue use of just holding it. The daisy chain linking sounds like a future plan for when it may be needed. The matching carrying bag is dope.In Closing: I highly recommend these if you're not trying to break the bank. Personally Headphones are for a enjoyable convenience. But if you truly enjoy true audio sound then may I suggest to investing into a Sound Speakers or a Home Theater for your home. As for OneOdio I look to see what other products you have to offer.Side note purchase: I also paired these up with ""Envil"" 3.5mm USB-A converter (In red to match the wire lol) I the same day for my PC / PS4 and the ""OneOdio"" sound sent into my ears did not disappoint.","Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020",AFECMTW6IDF5BN3SJATGIEMUO4JQ,True,0,Color: Red
RZOMPFN9VMGN1,B09D3MFSGJ,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, meh cables.",Coyote,3,"Sound quality is great for the price point, if the mix is good. Crappy mixes mastered for tiny laptop and cellphone speakers will sound muddy without EQ'ing the bass down, but that's an issue with the mastering, not the headphones. Otherwise, the sound is good. Punchy bass, crisp highs and mids. Everything I was looking for and expect, even at a higher price point. Durability remains to be seen, but the headphones are holding up well so far.The biggest shortfall of these headphones is the same as just about every other set of headphones on the market... Fragile cables. Nobody puts enough strain relief on their cables and if you move around at all while wearing these, your cable will start to break almost instantly, leading to one or both channels dropping out and crackling randomly. Don't plan on using these while you're moving around unless you want to buy a new cable. Also, don't use these for your phone unless you're going to leave it on the table or carry it in your hand all the time. Putting it in your pocket or even a holster will put way too much strain on the cheap jacks. One bump, pull or a little bit of strain and the wires start to go. A 90 degree plug would help, but *nobody* uses them.These cables specifically seem to use the cheapest plugs available. Relatively thick insulation on the wires, but I suspect that's all for show and the actual wires themselves are the same hair-thin, ultra fragile crap that everybody else uses. Started having issues with the short cable after only about 2 weeks of wearing them around the house. The longer cable got me three uses before they started crackling and dropping out. Furthermore, it doesn't look like I can replace the 1/8th inch cable with a standard patch cable because that one is deep set with a flat spot.Final opinion: Buy them for the sound quality, but be prepared to purchase new cables. The 1/4"" side (on the left driver) is generic so you'll need to buy a 1/4"" to whichever size you need.Note: Before anyone says to just go wireless, I have a hard enough time just keeping my phone and laptop charged up when I'm on the go, I really don't need another thing to plug in every couple of hours.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AEJPYSR7UQ73S6B7LHLSIW4UBL4A,True,16,Color: Red

Lucas,4,"Good flat sound signature, not the most comfortable if you have a big head.I bought the Pro-30 version of these (same design except round puffy ear cushions) and read that some people like these better. I liked the idea of a bigger oval earphone so gave them a shot. Long story short I'll probably send these back. They aren't bad by any means, I just like the Pro-30s a little better.Comfort - these are by no means uncomfortable but they are not the ""make you ooh and ahh"" pillowy luxury of the Pro-30. The taller oval earpads didn't equal better comfiness for me. The clamp feels stronger too but that may ease with time.Sound - the sound is balanced and clear. There's plenty of gorgeous bass but not overwhelming, the midrange is smooth and right up front. The treble is crisp and not hissy or harsh. I would describe the sound curve as flat; very ""true"" to the original recording. If you're looking for smooth, balanced, pleasing tone that you could relax for hours listening to these will be great. You could happily fall asleep listening to these. The flip side is that these are not super dynamic by today's standards. To contrast the Pro-30s have bass that punches you in the face and treble that slaps you across the cheek. They are exciting and powerful but can get tiresome over long stretches. These are smooth as silk sound-wise. Not ""crazy fun"" but really nice.Features - love the no-adapter cable. Genius. These also have ""R"" and ""L"" imprinting on the inside of the driver dust cover- a small but super handy detail. I haven't tried the mic cord and probably won't. I don't like talking on the phone, especially through a headset. They fold up a little smaller than full size and come with a bag, probably won't use that either.Durability - these are cheaper heaphones. All plastic so I don't expect them to outlive me. They'll probably be just fine for several years of they're not abused. If you give them to a child they will probably destroy them after a while.If these had the comfort of the Pro-30s I would choose these. Since they don't I'll just turn down my bass and treble a little and use the Pro-30s. I paid less than $30 for these on sale so I might keep these for backup or a gift.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020",AFIURKRVVHPW2ARGJCNOC7EAHD6Q,True,4,Color: Silver Brown

Fair price and quality sound are two other positive benefits. When in use, these headphones don't automatically turn off the system speakers, but you should be able to simply cut off the system speakers if you want. You can hear your favorite music just fine on these headphones without bothering anyone else. Unless someone has a musically trained ear, most people will be very happy with the sound coming through the headphones!","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AFRG3ENTQZ2D2BZAQNF42L6DUAYQ,True,0,Color: Red

R3BOG0SEY3ZTA3,B09D3MFSGJ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Price Matches Quality, Can't Go Wrong with Them.",Chris...,5,"Let's start with the negatives because there are so few of them, and they are minor. First, the wire that comes with them could a tad bit longer. Second, I'm noticing in the coils in the coiled part of the wire like to flip at the ends so you get that 'U"" shape that always appears on long phone cords (for those of you old enough to remember that). Finally, at the end of the day, if I am wearing these constantly for several hours, my ear can be a little tender. However, a slight adjustment to make sure the pressure point is off the ear fixes that. Perhaps an oversight they might fix with a future version is to make the input jack on the phones the same size on both ears. This way, if you're cord is coming from the left, you don't have to reverse the headphones. But again, all these things are minor.As for the positives, let's start with sound quality. At low and mid-level volume, there's very little difference between these and the vastly more expensive Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones I own and love. At louder volumes, there's a bit of a buzz, but we're talking volumes loud enough that it'd cause hearing damage if normally used at that level. For everyday normal use, the sound is fantastic.Physically, although plastic, the headphones still feel solid with a bit of heft to them, but aren't weighty. Perhaps one of the more fascinating idea is that you add a second pair of phones via an included wire so two people can listen to music or watch something (although I have not tried it). Even though I mentioned the ear soreness above after a full day, the overall feel of the headphones is very comfortable. There's good tension on the phones so they don't fall off my head easily, but the pressure against the ear is negligible as well. The material on ear cushions and the band holding the two parts together is soft to the touch and feels well crafted (but time will tell).All said and done, I spent $40 (including tax) for these headphones. Right now, I see they're selling for around $34 before tax, which is a very fair price.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2020",AFQY2DYMUMIHCSX3FNBA5TWM25YA,True,2,Color: Red

For a pair of $30 headphones, I would highly recommend any newbie to a whole new world of sound! I was skeptical about everyone's reviews about how amazing they were compared to $300 headphones and you know what? I think these do hold their own against them. These have perfect noise cancelling, or muffling in my words, because I don't want to be completely deaf when enjoying my computer sessions.

R2TN1PJ0JP3YL4,B09D3MFSGJ,3.0 out of 5 stars Someone at OneOdio is not listening to these headphones.,Ray,3,"Hi, Well, this time I really am not to sure how to start this review. The headband is generally the same one used on the $35 2canz, except on these phones the fasteners are smaller to fit the smaller cavity of the phones. Yeah, they are comfortable. They have that little extra padding inside the ear cup to make it more comfortable for the ear to sit in.The company Moukey who makes headphones stated that there isn't any real difference between a 40mm and 50mm driver. I think I'll take their word on that. So here's my experience.I bought one pair, and for the first time in my headphone listening life found that both drivers sounded different. In this case, the left side sounded better in that the bass response was still there, but the mids and hights were not so much sucked out. It was a more balanced sound. On the other hand, the right side was unfortunately, the typical ""V-shaped"" frequency response. A lot of flabby bass, sucked out mids and lots of highend.I then contacted Amazon, and they promptly sent me out a replacement pair. Unfortunately, these too suffered the same results. This time, not so bad, but the right side was better and the left side had the midrange pulled back. If only they at OneOdio would listen to these phones, maybe the driver quality would improve. I tried them on different devices, with both pairs being the same results I have told you about.One slight criticism of this model is the fact you can't just use your own 3.5 mil cord. You have to use there cord on the right side. That protrusion on the bottom of the right side would have to be modified so you could use your own cord. So that's it for me and OneOdio. These in no way are anywhere close to ""studio."" I'd stay away from these phones. If OneOdio wishes to contact me to see what could be done to remedy these issues, I am open.I have returned them back to Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2022",AERKXQXSLPZHEPW6F6TPQUJCLFEQ,True,3,Color: Red

However, the band is a bit small, so even at max length it just barely fits over my ears. The Boompro does not fit in the 3.5mm jack. As you can see above, the included cable has another section that's kind of proprietary. Rather than trying to make it work there, I instead used one of my extra 1/4"" adapters, and it works fine.

R3NVOMCXGHK1X4,B08629PFFQ,3.0 out of 5 stars Great product. Poor durability.,CaveatEmptor,3,"As my hearing deteriorated I began having trouble following dialog on TV. In November 2020 I bought a soundbar and the Avantree Ensemble headphones to see if either would help. The soundbar helped a little but the Avantree headphones were fantastic! I gave away the sound bar and used the Avantree headphones every day after that. The sound quality is great, there is no lag between between the TV audio and the headphones, you can turn the TV sound off and use only the headphones so no-one else is disturbed, the over-the-ear earpads are comfortable and, as a bonus, they block most ambient noise making the TV audio even clearer, headphone volume adjusts easily without taking them off.After a few months the headband snapped. The headband (the part that goes over your head) is a thin plastic strip and clearly not durable. The constant, but gentle, flexing putting the headphones on and off weakens the band until it snaps. Other reviewers have reported the same problem. This is a design flaw and it needs to be fixed; my other headphones, some much older, do not have this problem, so it is definitely fixable. I repaired the snapped headband by gluing a flexible plastic splint over the broken band, and then taping it all together for added strength. This worked OK but the headphones ended up a little looser than before.In June 2023 the headphones would no longer charge when placed in the charging base. It was as if the headphones and charging base were no longer making good electrical contact. I could have charged the headphones using a cable, but that is a lot less convenient than just placing them in the base after use.I loved the product and its original convenience so much, I bought the same product again to replace my now faulty ensemble. The new headphones are great, as before, but I worry about the headband snapping again, and the charging base eventually not working. The last set lasted only 2 years and 7 months, much of that with a broken & repaired headband. For a product that costs almost $100 after tax, that is a disappointing lifespan.Bottom line: the Avantree Ensemble is a fantastically effective convenient product that improved my life enormously.

At each and every step of the way, there was Rie sending me information about the status of my return with detailed information to help along the way.Rie was always in direct communication with me and I felt that her experience shined, it was this person in their customer support which really impressed me with this company. To keep things simple, she was the only person that I was in contact at each step of the way.I will certainly come back in the future for my audio headset needs in the future.Lastly, I would like to let people know about their on/off switch on the Avantree Ensemble (Headsets). With this unit you just flip a switch (on or off), gone is the step of holding down a power button waiting for your headset unit to connect with the base and then the same thing in order to power off your headset. Flip the switch on or off and you're done!I hope this information helps somebody out there with their purchase :)","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AHD5WNNDDTCQ2IHIYRMWP2QVVTQQ,True,1,
R1F6NRQKU22NLP,B08629PFFQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, only one con!",Robert C Hailes Jr,4,"These Wireless TV headphones are excellent!The pros overwhelmingly outweigh the con.These are better than the Sennheiser RS 120 and RS 175, that dropped in and out of connection when I got close to my Internet router, or a microwave in use.The only con with the Avantree’s is that treble (highs) sound distorted especially with music. This is the only category where the Sennheiser RS 175 wins. Can’t beat the sound quality of the RS 175.But for $100 the Avantree’s are a far better choice than any other wireless TV headphones that I’ve tried so far.Tip: after you hook up the optical cord, and change your TV speaker output to optical output, you may also have to change your HDMI- CEC to PCM within your TV expert Settings for your headphones to work.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AEXMXTJ7BTGODVEX2JBXWS3AAS3Q,True,0,

I was worried since they weren't active noise cancelling like my last headphones, there'd be a lot of ambient noise. Turns out it's very easy to tune that out. The overall sound quality is such that I often find myself becoming very engrossed in whatever I am listening to, in a way that's sort of new to me. Which is to say, I am very pleased with the listening experience from these headphones. Everyone is of course different when it comes to sound, but to sum it up: I am not disappointed in the least by the lack of ANC or the sound quality.The only thing I'm kinda disappointed in is the docking station. For whatever reason, it's possible to put the headset in the station and not have it make contact with the charging contacts. I find myself constantly having to jimmy it around until it finally seats properly. About 3/5 times I place the headphones in the docking station and walk away, only to hear a faint, ""Welcome to Avantree!"" and have to go back to jostle it until it makes contact. I think what's happening is when I put the headphones in the station, they make contact just long enough to make the headphones think it's about to charge (which causes them to enter charging mode), but then the weight of the headphones causes them to rock backwards and out of contact, which makes the headphones think they've been picked up and are about to be used. It's a little annoying, and frankly if I had known this before I had gotten them, I may have gone with another product.That said, I'll be hanging onto these now that I have them. The range (significantly longer than my other bluetooth headphones) and weight (possible to comfortably wear these for hours) are excellent as well, and the charging thing isn't enough of a deal breaker to make me send them back.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2023",AHCTJD6RQKWWYDMBYNUBGPZF33DA,True,11,

The headphones have significantly improved her daily routine, allowing her to enjoy her favorite music, and TV shows in comfort.First off, the setup process was incredibly straightforward. My grandmother, who is not particularly tech-savvy, was able to connect the headphones to her devices without any hassle. The simplicity of the design and user interface made it a breeze for her to understand and use them right out of the box.Comfort is another aspect where these headphones truly shine. They are lightweight and have soft, cushioned ear pads that fit perfectly. She can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort.The sound quality is outstanding. It delivers clear, rich sound that enhances her listening experience, whether she's enjoying classical music or the latest mystery novel. The noise-canceling feature is a bonus, helping her stay immersed in her audio without being disturbed by the background noise.Battery life is impressive as well. She doesn't have to worry about charging them frequently, which is a huge plus for both of us. The headphones easily last through several days of moderate to heavy use, making them very reliable.Overall, these headphones have been a game changer. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for practical wireless headphones.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AET7SYUFTHQEBHXBWEKZEXVFIC5A,True,18,

For me the biggest plus - they really enhance voice clarity when watching a movie with ""too loud"" background music. Now I can hear what actors are saying. Negatives - not the best sound quality when listening to music. Lose out on the depth, layers of sound. Also the difference between the lowest volume level on headset and next step up is way too big! I have really good hearing. Need much more gradual volume increases. Don't know if this will be a deal breaker. My old JVC headset was great in this regard ( could move sound volume up in really small, gradual increments). Almost seems like these headphones are made for those with some hearing loss. Range seems good - can walk around house and still hear. Don't yet know how comfortable headset will be after wearing for any extended period.

RAI90QWJQJF03,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Literally mind-blowing upgrading from AirPods Pro 2,Christian Waymire,5,"Beats**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**Two notes about me:* I have a pretty average sized head & ears* I wear glassesThoughts:- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.- I can FEEL the bass.- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I’ve heard.- Classical sounds amazing—way better than AirPods Pro 2.- Folk sounds amazing, & it’s like someone’s playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.- Piano also sounds especially amazing- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there—they also barely fit (see pictures).- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.- Box is very sleek & giftable.- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it’s not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it’s not so uncomfortable that I don’t want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it’s not any real inconvenience.- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out—USB-C or a lightening cord would’ve been way better.- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it’s a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn’t trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that’d be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it’s just barely big enough for that.- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don’t have that and I’m left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you’re looking for good bluetooth headphones and don’t have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn’t be happier. They’re definitely a good value at $200, but they’re mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren’t are barely worth commenting on.Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not. I’d highly recommend buying if they’re in your budget!!!","Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2023",AH6FFZWTYTQH3JFZKOI4VDFSDWRA,True,440,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R2IQV1A1SCQDVZ,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars These headphones deserve the hype!,Mariah Chapman,5,"At last I finally found the perfect wireless headphones!! I bought these back in November when they were on sale for Black Friday (only $80!) and wanted to give them a test period before I reviewed them. Here’s what I’ve experienced this far:Pros1. The sound quality is impeccable. Literally everything is so clear and crisp. Funny enough, to put it into perspective, I was watching a movie and did not notice faint background music until I put these headphones on.2. The battery life is great. For me, they last roughly 72 hours before I need to fully recharge them. With charging, it takes maybe 40 minutes to an hour to get back up to a full charge. Impressive3. They’re compact and foldable. You’d be surprised how many headsets don’t fold when you’re done using them but these are perfect if you need to travel.4. They can connect to anything! I connected them to the Bluetooth on my tv for the first time since I didn’t want to wake my roommate up at 2am and set up was easy and simple.5. Changing the volume or song is simple and easy.6. Not really a pro, just an opinion, but they are really cute and stylish.Cons:1. A lot of people were right about them hurting your ears after having them on for too long; maybe more than 4 hours of continuous wear. I wish the part that goes around your ears was a little bigger to minimize the discomfort, but nonetheless it’s not a huge deal.2. Don’t connect them to numerous things at once. For instance, I had these paired with my iPhone and laptop at the same time. When I turned on my laptop it disconnected from my iPhone automatically and vice versa. My suggestion, disconnect from the device you’re not using and only focus on one sole device at a time.3. I wish the charger came with a charging block instead of just a wire. If you don’t have an extra block make sure you get one.4. They are not 100% noise cancelling but it does block out a good amount of outside noise5. My only concern is that when you call someone or someone calls you there’s a weird echo in the background. Like every time you talk it sounds like you’re talking in a tunnel? Again not a big deal just something I’ve noticed.Overall, I’m really happy with this purchase and if you’re considering getting these just do it. I really needed them for studying purposes and they get the job done 100%.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AHKIWC4UYPVHMRXYTTGAEA655Q2Q,True,140,Color: SilverStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

From their sleek design to their impressive battery life, these headphones have quickly become a favorite accessory in my daily life.One of the standout features of the Beats Solo3 headphones is their immersive sound quality. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the audio is crisp, clear, and full-bodied, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the listening experience.The wireless connectivity is another major selling point for these headphones. Thanks to the Apple W1 headphone chip and Class 1 Bluetooth technology, pairing the headphones with my devices is seamless and hassle-free. Plus, with up to 40 hours of listening time on a single charge, I never have to worry about running out of battery during long commutes or flights.However, it's important to note that the ear covers on the Beats Solo3 headphones may not fully cover the ears, which can cause discomfort for those with sensitive ears. As someone who prefers over-ear headphones for this reason, I did notice some discomfort after extended periods of use.Overall, despite this minor issue, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone in search of stylish, high-quality headphones with impressive sound and wireless convenience. Just be mindful of the ear cover size if you have sensitive ears.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHUPUXWKEITRCH5VBW4S7D33I7LA,True,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
R1SLLOFV53BSY,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these.,Bart,5,"I got my first pair in 2016 for free from Apple when I bought a computer with my student discount. I used them every day until sometime in 2023 when the overhead band snapped. So I bought these to replace them.I have a very small head and stretched earlobes. Most over ear head phones are way too big and fall off if I look down. Or they sit in a way that makes my plugs dig into the pressure point behind the ear lobe. These head phones do neither. They fit snug without hurting my hears, these are on ear not over the ear. They do start to ache if I wear them for several hours with my glasses on though, like if I’m on a flight for a long time. But I think that happens with most headphones.They have great base and are great for noise cancelling. They fully charge in about on hour. Maybe less.Definitely recommend if you’ve got a small head and shuffle to find headphones that stay on. If you’re a giant man with a giant head, don’t get these. They’ll be too small.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AFM3O6PY6AYDORNPO4BIMBHD4TYQ,True,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

And on top of that, they can charge from dead to full in like an hour or so. I'm sure there are products with better sound quality and noise canceling but for the low price and insane battery life they're definitely better than most other products ive seen.They're comfortable and easily adjusted, my only complaint is that they're fairly tight so it can hurt your ears after a few hours but that's bound to happen with any headphones.Overall great product, I've used them every day since I bought them and never once regretted my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AF6CZPUOUWRIFXF4VB3VFLZGYCDA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
R1NPJGY6ZELSU,B0CCBKGDJD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running, ear pads a bit small",M,4,"I run outdoors frequently and was looking for a decent pair of headphones because my area is noisy and I was tired of constantly adjusting my airpods while running. I wanted something with serviceable audio quality that I also wouldn't mind putting through the constant wear and tear of sweaty runs. I was previously wearing a more expensive pair of headphones to run, and while I do prefer those for use at home or for noise-canceling, they were too heavy and hot for running and I was worried about damaging them. The beats solo3 are a better fit for this particular use case (for me).Pros:- the apple bluetooth chip is extremely useful, it makes it so much more convenient to switch between devices! Major QOL improvement over other headphones I own- lightweight and don't make my ears hot during exercise- stay put well even with a lot of movement (I've even worn these while hanging upside down at the gym and they didn't fall off)- blocks out the perfect amount of sound for outdoor running, such that I'm not distracted by ambient noise but I still have enough situational awareness to hear a car honking at me at close range- audio quality is better than any of my in-ear headphones, which is really all I needed in this case- battery life is great, I never find myself running out of battery even though I use these quite a bitCons:- My primary reason for deducting a star: I was expecting these to be over-ear, but they're actually more like on-ear; the ear pads are a bit tight and sometimes they start to hurt my ears after wearing them for longer periods of time, usually after ~45 minutes (I'd be especially cautious if you have any cartilage piercings)- It's a bit hard to use the control buttons sometimes- the double tap to skip is a little finicky, sometimes if I press too quickly in succession or not hard enough it doesn't register. The volume controls are so much smaller and so far to the top and bottom, respectively, that I sometimes accidentally hit the center pause button instead. Still convenient to have controls there, but they have room for improvement. I also find myself wishing that I could use the controls from either side instead of just the one, but that's not a big deal.- I worry that the band might be damaging my hair a bit, as it's a pretty grippy material. It's not pulling out any hair, but I do wish it had a bit more slip since the headphones feel tight enough to stay put regardless","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2024",AHMFDYUZPJZD6H4D22HIWLJNTG4A,True,15,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

I turn them off after every use and have not had to charge them yet.Pretty comfortable overall , I have worn them a few times for over an hour during hikes and walks outside. ( an hour and 45min at the most ) and found that my ears were slightly sore after that time frame but not painful at all.( I have not done any running in them)Lightweight and compact enough to take with me on the go-I didn’t like that I could not get them back into the small bag they came in easily. It seems to be a very tight fit to get them in and out even when they are collapsed fully so I have not been using the bag they came in for storage .Other than that they work great for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2024",AFDBDFGWMV6V4NKQXW3PFJ7RPVDQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R2P3JRB3XRYY3I,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars the best headphones,Angel,4,"The best headphones. I was looking for the perfect headphones with the qualities of sound cancellation , durability, color and comfortability and I found the perfect ones. How i even found out about this product is because one day i was working out at the gym with my cousin and i need music loud enough and my airpods was not loud enough for me so me and my cousin swapped and i was so satisfied with the loudness of it and i was so focused and encouraged to finish my workout. I really like these because of the sound cancellation mostly , when I am doing my school work working out and I don't want to hear anything I put these on and everything on the outside just goes mute and the headphones just do their job. In a lot of headphones I feel like the advertisement is really fake. As someone who has tried the majority of wireless headphones this one is probably one of my favorites so far. But I do have some dislikes and likes about this product starting off with the dislikes . first thing i would like to start of with is how big the headphones are like there so noticeable and there just there i wish there were smaller nad like airpods sort of another dislike is u could hear the music out the headphones loud and clear so it's like whatever your listing to others can hear which i honestly hate that. Next is that you can lay down with them like if u were laying down on your ear its just super uncomfortable because like i said on how big it is. Now let's move on to the like starting off with the ear muffs they put on the headphone . The earmuffs are what makes this product super comfortable and if it's cold your ears will be warm because of the earmuffs. Next is the loudness of course like i said in the beginning and the sound cancellation. Finally, I love how this product has multiple colors and they are all beautiful but the color I have is just out of this world which is the pink rose gold color love love love this color is just such a pretty color and it's my type of vibe. My honest review for the headphone is 4.8/5 these are great headphones and they have everything you need in them i just personally don't like hoe big and bulky they are and how you can hear the music outside the headphones but other than that love this product and i highly recommend you buy this for a friend or family member or even yourself if your looking for a headphone with noise cancellation and loudness to it .","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2023",AEOW7ZE5YPXQQLYVVXAFJ5WKTXLA,True,15,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

RWAWWHNPITXJD,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Style and Performance,Eric W.,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, they have left a lasting impression on me. From their sleek design to impressive sound quality and long-lasting battery life, these headphones have become my constant companion for both daily commutes and intense workout sessions.First and foremost, the design of the Beats Solo3 headphones is striking. The sleek and streamlined appearance, combined with the iconic Beats logo, exudes a sense of modernity and style. The headphones come in a variety of attractive colors, allowing users to express their personality and preferences. The on-ear design is comfortable and snug, providing a secure fit that stays in place even during vigorous activities.The sound quality is undeniably excellent. The Beats Solo3 headphones deliver a powerful and bass-heavy sound signature that suits various music genres. The bass response is deep without overpowering the vocals and trebles, resulting in an immersive audio experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks, watching movies, or playing games, the headphones never fail to impress with their rich and dynamic sound.The wireless connectivity is a game-changer. Pairing the Beats Solo3 with my devices is effortless, thanks to the Apple W1 chip. The Bluetooth connection remains stable and reliable, allowing me to move around without any dropouts. Additionally, the on-ear controls are intuitive and easy to use, enabling me to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with a simple tap.The battery life of the Beats Solo3 headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge, I rarely have to worry about running out of power during extended use. Moreover, the Fast Fuel feature is incredibly handy, providing three hours of playback after just a 5-minute charge, perfect for those last-minute situations.The headphones also feature a built-in microphone, which works well for making calls and using voice assistants like Siri. However, the microphone's performance in noisy environments could be improved, as it tends to pick up background noise.Comfort-wise, the on-ear design may not be suitable for everyone, especially during prolonged wear. Some users might experience slight discomfort or ear fatigue after extended use, but this can be alleviated by adjusting the fit and taking short breaks.While the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones deliver impressive sound quality and wireless convenience, the premium price tag might be a deterrent for some budget-conscious consumers. However, the product's performance and brand reputation are likely to justify the investment for audiophiles and fans of the Beats brand.In conclusion, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a stylish and reliable choice for music enthusiasts seeking powerful sound and seamless wireless functionality. With a few minor improvements in comfort and microphone performance, these headphones could easily score a perfect rating. If you prioritize style, sound quality, and long-lasting battery life, the Beats Solo3 headphones won't disappoint.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2023",AH6BBFPUMBAE5YUGOFBLLM7KBGLQ,True,86,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

They hurt my ears if they’re on for a long period of time but that’s usually how it goes for headphones. I will say that one small complaint I have is that my hair keeps getting pulled out due to strands getting stuck in the opening on the sides so it results in me having to carefully pull them out or they’ll get pulled. Another small complaint is that people can hear the music you’re listening to if you have it on high volume, but I tend to listen to music on high volume so that could be a me issue. Other than that I’m satisfied with the headphones and the sound quality and price is very agreeable :)","Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024",AHSBGKKIP4UDGIBF7Y7ROTSVKWBQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R2RAY6TSYGNK51,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best of 3 in comparison,Paul Ratzlaff,5,"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears. I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better. I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AFDUE4P2K26EO2ZHXFVG4TUTJRGQ,True,14,Color: SilverStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R18SYH8M0MNZTT,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones but some cons.,Amazon Customer,4,"These beats are really great and the adjustable thing on the top really lets them fit nice on your head. And the sound quality is actually amazing. On top of that, beats and apple have some sort of connected/deal (idrk) and because of this, when you turn them on, they automatically pair directly to your iPhone (I have a 14) and don’t make you go thru any annoying pairing process every time. They also directly show the beats icon, connection, and battery life directly on your iPhone. You also get a free month trial of Apple music plus. My only issue is that the ear part that surrounds your ear is rather small, so this may be an issue, and it is for me. After a while, my ears kinda begin to feel annoyed or hurt because it is not encompassing my full ear, so I feel that either the price of them, they could maybe have made them a little bigger. And the travel case is also pretty small and tight. I am pretty sure beats has a more expensive and different option that does fully surround your ear but it’s pretty pricey. Overall these are great and easy to use headphones.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AGQSAINEOWRMNFUFUMHQMLSOJJHQ,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
